How do custom orders work on Kraken?

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,820
Imagine I'm a music producer, dialing in my newest track.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,800
Need more bass? Crank it!

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,180
Vocals not popping? Double it up!

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,780
Want a bigger sound? Hit that reverb. Hard.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,880
That's custom orders on Kraken.

Complete control over your crypto trades.

00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,840
Go to kraken.com and see what crypto can be.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,920
Don't invest unless you're prepared to lose all the money you invest.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,660
This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,900
Hey, everybody. I'm Ashley C. Ford, and I'm the host of Into the Mix,

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,200
a Ben & Jerry's podcast about joy and justice, produced with Vox Creative.

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,220
And in our new miniseries, we're talking about voter fraud.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,300
For years now, former President Donald Trump has made it a key talking point,

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,420
despite there being no evidence of widespread fraud.

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,860
But what impact do claims like these have on ordinary voters?

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,980
People like Olivia Coley Pearson, a civil servant in Douglas, Georgia,

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,640
who was arrested for voter fraud because she showed a first-time voter how the voting machines worked.

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,660
Hear how she fought back on the latest episode of Into the Mix.

Today's number, $762,000.

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,400
That's how much Republican PACs have spent at the Capitol Grill Steakhouse this election cycle.

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,280
Ed, how do you bring a Republican to his knees?

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,340
You paint your dick orange.

25
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:12,560
Hello, Ed. How are you?

26
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,420
I'm good. I'm more excited by that number than I am by the joke.

27
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,960
$750,000 to the Capitol Grill is one of the greatest statistics we've had on this podcast so far.

28
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,140
Yeah, but it's nothing compared to the amount of revenue that Grindr recognized in Milwaukee the weekend at the convention.

29
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,160
That's a good point. I'm sure they're correlated. I'm sure they both had spikes at the same time.

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:39,960
So the most interesting thing about that stat, Ed, is that that is 13 times the amount of money that the Democrats spent. It's crazy, no?

31
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,800
It's unbelievable. What do you think is the Capitol Grill equivalent for the Democrats?

32
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,520
Epstein's Island.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,720
That was good. That was good.

34
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,000
That is good. Do you like the Capitol Grill? What's your favorite restaurant these days?

35
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,020
I'm sort of a creature of habit. My favorite restaurant in London is Granger & Co.

36
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,860
I started going there when I spent a summer here and it's in Marlebone.

37
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,960
My favorite restaurant, period, is In-N-Out Burger, but in New York, my new favorite is Sartiano's.

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,360
Because I know Scott Sartiano and I like him and it's cool and I see celebs there and I kind of feel like I'm like, oh, hi.

39
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,520
And they treat me nice because I know Scott and I feel big time there.

40
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,540
What's your favorite restaurant? What do young, cool people eat?

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,880
Isodi in the West Village is pretty great. Pretty good pasta.

42
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,200
I haven't been to Sartiano's. I'd like to try it out.

43
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,720
Granger is great. And the ricotta pancakes are sort of a staple there. Have you tried those?

44
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:38,100
Yeah, of course. Although I had all this blood work done and I'm used to walking into the room like I just want, like I'm Simone Biles and I've just stuck the landing whenever I have blood work done.

45
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:47,340
And she's like, well, this is a bit of an issue. We need to talk about this. I'm like, huh? What? Wait, no, I'm me. I'm like crazy healthy. I'm getting old, Ed.

46
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:54,900
And I kept asking her to take my blood pressure until it was fine. I'm like, no, take it again. Take it again.

47
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,700
And why are we talking about this? Do you think your diet has something to do with this? Why are we on blood work now?

48
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:12,440
I have no idea. I got here. I had maybe that's part of the problem. So I've spent the last two mornings for two to three hours getting NADs. Do you know what these are?

49
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:19,820
They supposedly it's basically biohacking. I'm convinced it's biohacking for rich people. Rich people, I think they can live longer than other people.

50
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:28,760
So they do all this stupid shit. And I think I've fallen into this trap. So it's these it stands for some nuclear atomic diaclide or something.

51
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,840
And supposedly it activates cell growth. And I don't know. You're not going to recognize me on next week's pod.

52
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,400
I'm just going to be. You're going to be ripped. I don't even need to be ripped anymore. I just want to be this adorable little Jewish. I want to look like Barbra Streisand and Yentl.

53
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,380
I just want to look young and feminine. Wait, is this my way of coming out?

54
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,320
You want to look like Timothee Chalamet, I think is what you're describing.

55
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,520
I don't know if it's his NADs, but my brain is just firing in a billion different directions right now.

56
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,860
OK, well, let's let's take all this energy and point it towards the markets now.

57
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,420
Let's do it.

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,620
And start with our weekly review of Market Vitals.

59
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,180
The S&P 500 declined. The dollar rose. Bitcoin fell. And the yield on 10-year treasuries increased.

60
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:22,380
Shifting to the headlines. Tesla's quarterly deliveries rose for the first time this year, up more than 6% from a year earlier.

61
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,680
However, that metric still came in below analyst expectations and the stock fell 3% on the news.

62
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,760
CVS is considering breaking up its pharmacy and insurance businesses as it looks to improve operations.

63
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,860
The company is also pursuing cost-cutting initiatives, including cutting nearly 3,000 jobs.

64
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:46,660
And finally, venture capital firm CRV is returning more than half of the money from its $500 million select fund to investors.

65
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:56,100
The firm decided to cut the select fund, which invested in mature startups, after consistently seeing valuations that were too high to get a decent return.

66
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,980
Scott, your thoughts, starting with Tesla's quarterly delivery update.

67
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:12,000
The biggest trend, I think, in auto is that while everyone wanted to follow Musk because he's got a three-quarter of a trillion dollar market cap and it was all about EVs, it ends up that may have been wrong.

68
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,100
And Ford and General Motors went all in.

69
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,940
And Toyota, which in my view is the best-managed automobile company in the world, said, no, we're not going to go after the NFT of EVs.

70
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,220
And they made a big bet on hybrids.

71
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,220
And the consumer is actually moving towards hybrids.

72
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,160
And hybrids basically offer a lot of the upside of electric.

73
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,780
It's more efficient, less carbon or less shit into the air, and it doesn't rely on the grid.

74
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,920
So you have more range, less insecurity about being caught somewhere without a charging station.

75
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,320
They're actually less expensive.

76
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,040
And Toyota is kind of killing it right now.

77
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:58,980
And despite the fact that Toyota is killing it and growing faster than Tesla, really well positioned and made a huge investment on the right horse, and that is hybrids as opposed to EVs.

78
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:05,740
It trades at 0.8 times revenues, whereas Tesla trades at 8 to 9 times revenues.

79
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,540
So one of these things is either vastly overvalued or one of them is vastly undervalued.

80
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:19,780
But we're so obsessed with Tesla because of the individual at the head of that company that we don't talk about general trends in the industry.

81
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,580
And I think it's all about hybrids.

82
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,320
Yeah, it is interesting how the EV used to be sort of the sexiest two letters in the auto industry.

83
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,120
And it's kind of just so ubiquitous now.

84
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,860
It doesn't have that level of hype and sex appeal that it used to.

85
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,820
And so Tesla has to rely on different hype stories now.

86
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:42,920
And I think that's why I believe that these quarterly delivery updates are becoming less and less important.

87
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,580
You know, essentially the story is they pretty much met expectations.

88
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,580
They remain just ahead of BYD in terms of overall EV deliveries.

89
00:07:53,340 --> 00:08:00,320
The overall message, and we'll get a fuller picture of earnings in a couple of weeks, but the overall message is, you know, things are going fine-ish for Tesla.

90
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:07,040
But more importantly for Tesla, this Thursday is their big robotaxi event.

91
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,580
And I think that's more important than the numbers because, as we've talked about with Tesla before, the valuation is all about the narrative.

92
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,440
This is the big moment where people will ask the question, is the robotaxi actually legit?

93
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,720
My prediction is that that robotaxi event will be a giant letdown.

94
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,400
Two tells, for me, why that's going to happen.

95
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,460
One is the narrative leading up to it.

96
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,360
Elon has a habit of overpromising and under-delivering.

97
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,980
But he isn't even overpromising about this event.

98
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,300
He's barely talking about it.

99
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:43,740
He's spending most of his time shitposting about politics, which makes me think that he believes that this robotaxi is going to underwhelm.

100
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,740
And the second tell for me is the location of the event.

101
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,820
They're doing it at the Warner Brothers studio in Burbank, which to me says, this is going to be a cinematic event.

102
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,000
This isn't actually going to be a sort of technological showcase.

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:07,660
This is just going to be a big production, sexy commercial about what the robotaxi could look like, as opposed to a tangible demonstration of what it actually looks like right now.

104
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,600
So my prediction would be that this robotaxi event that's happening end of this week will be highly underwhelming.

105
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,300
And I think the stock is going to suffer as all of the hype and the excitement around Tesla continues to deflate.

106
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:30,060
Your thoughts on CVS evaluating spinning out their insurance and their healthcare businesses separate from their consumer business?

107
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,120
There's a lot here.

108
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,520
Essentially, they're deconglomerating.

109
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:44,460
They saw Amazon coming and they felt like they needed to bulk up and take advantage of the user interface or the customer interface they had and thought, we can upsell you upstream to insurance.

110
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,460
We can upsell you or downsell you downstream to one-minute clinics.

111
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,720
I've actually used those clinics a couple of times for vaccines.

112
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,100
And I thought they were really, really good.

113
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,640
But what happens with a conglomerate is you end up paying a conglomerate tax.

114
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,980
And that is when the New York Times CEO thinks, you know, newspapers are a shitty business.

115
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,540
I don't want to just answer for one company.

116
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,500
I want to diversify.

117
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,660
So they go and buy a bunch of other newspapers and then buy the building, their headquarters.

118
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,320
At one point, the New York Times building was worth more than the entire company.

119
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,860
So it had become a REIT accidentally.

120
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,800
They own 70% of the Boston Red Sox.

121
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
Makes no fucking sense.

122
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,680
I remember when I asked the CEO, I don't know if you know this or not,

123
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,060
but I was on the board of the New York Times that.

124
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,640
I need a bell.

125
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,340
Where's my bell?

126
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,320
In the boarding, they said, Scott Galloway, director.

127
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,460
What do you think?

128
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,920
We were talking about capital strategy.

129
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,460
And I'm like, why do we own the Boston Red Sox?

130
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,120
And Janet Robinson, the CEO of the Times said,

131
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,740
because we get special insight into Boston athletics.

132
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm like, oh, yeah.

133
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,360
I know about this story, but that's a very interesting detail I have not heard before.

134
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,480
Well, it's called bullshit.

135
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,220
She was trying to justify an asset they own for no real reason.

136
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,580
And I'm like, oh, yeah, we're known for our coverage of the Celtics.

137
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,920
But it made no sense.

138
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,260
But what happens is CEOs love to get – their incentive is to get bigger.

139
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,840
Now, why do they want to get bigger?

140
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,500
Because their compensation is based on the following.

141
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,460
Directors don't like to do any work.

142
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,380
The compensation committee hires a firm called Towers Perrin to come in

143
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,120
and look at compensation.

144
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,640
They say, okay, Janet Robinson, the CEO of the New York Times,

145
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,720
it's a media company that is doing $5 billion in revenue.

146
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,520
That's the thing.

147
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,180
What kind of sector it's in, the size of the company.

148
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,080
And then they say the average person running a $5 billion media company

149
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,040
gets this much in compensation and this much in stock options.

150
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:34,740
So the incentive of the CEO is to diversify such that their life is just less anxious, right?

151
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,500
If one brand isn't doing well, the other is usually doing a bit better.

152
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,940
It kind of smooths out the earnings.

153
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,420
And two, the bigger the company, you typically, the higher the compensation.

154
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,200
So there are a lot of incentives to try and have a game-changing acquisition.

155
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,820
And two-thirds of acquisitions do not work.

156
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,040
People overpay for them because they get excited.

157
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,000
They don't realize this business is hard.

158
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,780
Integration problems.

159
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,380
You have to pay a premium to take out the other shareholders.

160
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,860
So they very rarely work.

161
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,700
When they work, they can work hugely.

162
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,820
Meta is probably the best acquirer in history.

163
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,060
Instagram, which they purchased for a billion, is probably worth a couple hundred billion.

164
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,160
But the vast majority of the time, they're not.

165
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:18,140
Now, on the flip side, what almost always works is the disposition of assets or spends.

166
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,800
Because in a conglomerate where investors think, you know, I don't need you to diversify for me.

167
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,100
I can go buy an insurance company all on my own.

168
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,960
So I don't like this kind of milquetoast, amorphous Frankenstein of a company.

169
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,720
So they end up, typically the market says, let's find the shittiest business

170
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,000
and assign that multiple to the entire thing.

171
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,040
You end up with this company that, despite perhaps having good assets,

172
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,460
trades at the multiple of a shitty retailer in decline.

173
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,560
So this insurance company that they own would probably trade at a much higher multiple for

174
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,320
an independent company.

175
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,300
So the disposition of assets becomes accretive to shareholders.

176
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,920
Spins almost always work.

177
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,120
So I think this is a good idea.

178
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,600
Our final headline is CRV returning their money to investors, something you basically never

179
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,580
see venture capitalists doing.

180
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,460
What is your read on this?

181
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,620
Why have they done this?

182
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,220
And what does it say about the VC industry right now?

183
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,260
All of the returns are kind of aggregating to a small number of funds that are essentially

184
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,640
getting the best deal flow.

185
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,020
And they're looking for companies that they can put hundreds of millions or billions into

186
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,260
because they've raised so much capital.

187
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,480
And I think what you're seeing is this enormous shakeout in the VC community where you're either

188
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,840
one of these mega funds that before the returns on fund nine come in, you're already raising fund 10.

189
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:51,800
And because you get amazing deal flow, your institutional investors get good money or really

190
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:59,740
niche focused VC firms that bring a very specific knowledge like Lux Capital, Josh Wolf's company,

191
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:06,880
that's kind of this deep, serious, forward-looking technologies like brain scans, brain implants,

192
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,420
or nuclear power, whatever it is.

193
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,420
But just a smaller, medium-sized VC that's trying to invest in tech, you're kind of fucked.

194
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
You have no advantage.

195
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,500
You don't have the capital.

196
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,200
You're not getting good deal flow.

197
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,940
And so I think there's just going to be, I mean, there already is kind of a pretty serious shakeout.

198
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,960
And I think these guys have probably said, we can't find good deals.

199
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,280
And the few deals we find are just so expensive.

200
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,200
The market has taken startups.

201
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,160
I mean, it's sort of tempting right after I sold L2, I immediately went to, well, I'm going

202
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,860
to go raise, start another company.

203
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:46,220
Because the amount of money you can raise at a valuation, it really has gotten kind of

204
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,120
bad shit crazy.

205
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,280
But at that point, my attitude was as a quote unquote proven entrepreneur, there was maybe

206
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,880
two or three investors I would raise money for or I just wasn't going to raise.

207
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,900
And so to be a tier two here, it is really, really tough.

208
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,620
And as a whole, I just think it's a shitty asset class.

209
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,700
More specific to this CRV headline, it's really all about late stage VC.

210
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:17,620
They're still operating an early stage fund, which, you know, they didn't return the money

211
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:17,900
there.

212
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,340
I assume it's doing okay slash fine.

213
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,480
But their concern is late stage VC.

214
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,880
And just some statistics here.

215
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,160
Last year, late stage deal volume fell 53%.

216
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,420
And late stage funding, the amount of actual capital going into these late stage companies

217
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,120
fell 60%.

218
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,140
And in addition, we're seeing this giant drop off in IPO activity.

219
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,580
We've only had 150 new listings in the US this year.

220
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,660
You compare that to 2021, where we had more than a thousand new IPOs.

221
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,640
And so the general theme that we're seeing within VC is that we're seeing far fewer Series D

222
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,280
rounds, far fewer Series E rounds, far fewer companies are sort of breaching the surface

223
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,840
of growth stage and, you know, picking up steam and entering into the public capital markets.

224
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,360
My question to you would be, why is that happening?

225
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,120
I would speculate that that's a function of the fact that the IPO market has yet to emerge

226
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,060
from the sort of deep freeze it's been in for the last several years.

227
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,860
It's typically late stage investment is, all right, we need to short the balance sheet,

228
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,600
maybe make a few tuck in acquisitions, but we're basically getting cleaned up for an IPO.

229
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,780
And it's sort of right now the worst of both worlds.

230
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,260
And that is, it's expensive because these companies still have a, you know, the market is still

231
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,200
fairly hot for companies in the right sector.

232
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,320
But the IPO market is all but shut to just a few players.

233
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,580
So it's sort of like, okay, I'm paying a lot, hoping to get into liquidity in a market where

234
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,300
fewer companies are getting, are getting out.

235
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,540
It feels like deal flow is very downstream.

236
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,880
And what I mean by that, we're seeing far fewer IPOs recently.

237
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,440
And now we're seeing that also late stage deal flow is falling off a cliff and funding.

238
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:13,800
And I wonder if that means that this is going to continue to trickle down into early stage

239
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,240
startups.

240
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:21,040
And I wonder if the general theme is that we're seeing the ramifications of a world where simply

241
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,880
fewer successful companies are being created in general.

242
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,120
And, you know, we're just beginning to see the after effects of that.

243
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,200
We're seeing the impacts where the market is becoming more and more dominated by these

244
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,820
mega, mega giant companies, the Magnificent Seven, Big Tech, the companies that we constantly

245
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,900
talk about on this podcast.

246
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,920
And in the meanwhile, actual successful company formation has been slowly dying.

247
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,940
And we're beginning to see the ramifications of that in the public markets and then in late

248
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,260
stage.

249
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,320
And I wonder if that will continue to the point where suddenly maybe venture as an industry

250
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,340
is not a thing anymore.

251
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,900
Well, you just made the argument for Chair Khan.

252
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,060
That's her whole rap is that effectively what we have here is an ecosystem that says find

253
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,940
the monopoly or find the future monopoly.

254
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,420
And then once that company starts, a company starts to show market leadership in a hot sector,

255
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:22,040
you just try and out-raise everybody and just literally sweep the competition off the deck

256
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,200
with brute force with more and more capital.

257
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,880
And it just it's not a very healthy ecosystem.

258
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,060
What you have is a small number of apex predators where they introduce a reticulated anaconda to

259
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,680
an ecosystem.

260
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,960
And there's just no other species that can fight back.

261
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,540
So what you're saying is accurate.

262
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,880
And for me, it all kind of forward engineers to the fact that we just need dramatically more

263
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,520
antitrust.

264
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:56,140
Yeah, I think the other alternative for VCs is you either try to get a 10, 20, 30x return on the

265
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:03,080
company that you bet on that becomes a monopoly, or you're going for a one and a half to 2x return

266
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,560
where the company will be acqui-hired by a big tech company.

267
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,060
I can just speak from experience.

268
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,440
General Catalyst invested in my company, L2.

269
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,180
27 months later, they got three times their money back and they were disappointed.

270
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,380
Their attitude is you're either 10x or you're zero.

271
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,400
Which means so many VCs are going to get crushed now because there are fewer and fewer winners.

272
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,320
A hundred percent.

273
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,720
That's why I'm really not cut out for venture capital.

274
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,580
And I probably should never raise money from venture capitalists again.

275
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,360
Plus, at the age of 50, I probably shouldn't.

276
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:43,900
And that is my skill has been taking a company from A to D or E and selling it for a really good

277
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,360
valuation.

278
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,500
I build companies.

279
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,700
I built my first company.

280
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:55,460
I started a strategy firm and sold it for $33 million when it was doing 10 million in revenue

281
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,360
when I was, I don't know, 33 or 34.

282
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,880
And then L2 built it, got it to 20 million in revenue, sold it for 160 million.

283
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,340
That's what I'm good at.

284
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,340
My investors were sort of nonplussed by that.

285
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,480
I mean, they were happy.

286
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,100
They made money.

287
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,640
They were willing to invest with me again.

288
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,420
But in the venture business, they're like, go, baby, go.

289
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,780
Swing for the fucking fence.

290
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,880
And if you herniate a disc, okay, that's fine.

291
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,140
But we're not here for singles and doubles, folks.

292
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,220
The difference, the reason why I like working with private equity is you're in companies

293
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,120
and the private equity guys say, all right, we're going to give management 8% of the company.

294
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,560
We're all on the same page.

295
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,920
We're going to try and be in this thing three to seven years and then sell for two to three

296
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,860
X what we invested.

297
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:46,580
I find that's much healthier than a bunch of young guys from Stanford saying, 50X, baby,

298
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,860
50X.

299
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,000
It's just sort of, okay.

300
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,740
Wish me luck.

301
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,180
I'm going to try real hard.

302
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,460
Yeah, exactly.

303
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,900
We'll be right back after the break with a look at a new AI IPO.

304
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,480
If you're enjoying the show, hit follow and leave us a review on ProfG Markets.

305
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:34,460
We'll be right back.

306
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,820
Don't invest unless you're prepared to lose all the money you invest.

307
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,560
This is a high risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.

308
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,280
Support for the show comes from Oracle.

309
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,860
AI might be the most important new computer technology ever.

310
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,460
It's storming every industry and literally billions of dollars are being invested.

311
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,860
So buckle up.

312
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,640
The problem is that AI needs a lot of speed and processing power.

313
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,500
So how do you compete without costs spiraling out of control?

314
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,920
It's time to upgrade to the next generation of the cloud.

315
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,620
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or OCI.

316
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:15,680
OCI is a single platform for your infrastructure, database, application development and AI needs.

317
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,080
OCI has four to eight times the bandwidth of other clouds,

318
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,920
offers one consistent price instead of variable regional pricing.

319
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,500
And of course, nobody does data better than Oracle.

320
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,220
So now you can train your AI models at twice the speed and less than half the cost of other clouds.

321
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,580
If you want to do more and spend less, like Uber, 8x8 and Databricks Mosaic,

322
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,940
take a free test drive of OCI at oracle.com slash fox.

323
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,300
That's oracle.com slash fox.

324
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,760
Oracle.com slash fox.

325
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:57,940
Hey there, I'm Ashley C. Ford, and I host Into the Mix, a Ben and Jerry's podcast about joy and justice,

326
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,820
produced with Vox Creative.

327
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,920
As former President Donald Trump continues to claim, without evidence,

328
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,760
that voter fraud is a key issue in the 2024 presidential election,

329
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,220
we wanted to know,

330
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,600
what impact can claims like this have on ordinary voters?

331
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,560
Olivia Coley Pearson, or Miss Livy as she is known in her community,

332
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,780
comes from a family of proud voters and civil rights activists.

333
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,500
So as an adult, civil service came naturally to her.

334
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,180
In 2012, while she was volunteering at the polls,

335
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,320
a first-time voter asked Miss Livy how the voting machine worked.

336
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,180
And of course, she showed them.

337
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,940
Years later, in 2016, Miss Livy was arrested for voter fraud because of it.

338
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,720
In her mind, this arrest wasn't about voter fraud.

339
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,520
It was about intimidating Black voters.

340
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,360
Listen to her story on the first episode of our new three-part series on Into the Mix.

341
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,260
Out now.

342
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:08,260
We're back with Prof G Markets.

343
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,700
California-based chipmaker Cerebris Systems filed for an IPO that could raise up to $1 billion.

344
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:20,440
With an offering of that size, the NVIDIA Challenger could be valued at around $7 to $8 billion.

345
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,800
Cerebris showed strong, albeit early-stage growth for the first six months of 2024,

346
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,040
with revenue increasing more than 15-fold from a year earlier.

347
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:34,280
The trouble is, 87% of those sales came from just one company.

348
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,360
That company is G42, the top AI firm in the United Arab Emirates.

349
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,820
Should the US give Cerebris any trouble with its export licenses,

350
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,480
most of the company's revenue could be at risk.

351
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:52,200
Scott, what do you make of this IPO filing from Cerebris, perhaps the new NVIDIA?

352
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,920
Look, this is, never underestimate the market's ability to come up with a product when consumers

353
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,840
have cash in hand.

354
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,240
And you have a small number of companies that have kind of soaked up the majority of the

355
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,580
capital in the retail markets.

356
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:10,820
And that is, the SPAC market emerged because there were a lot of dentists and lawyers and

357
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,240
retail investors that thought, I would really like to be part of the Pepsi generation,

358
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,980
and I'm willing to buy a cool little company, even if Goldman Sachs doesn't think it's ready

359
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,820
for prime time.

360
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,400
And the demand was there amongst retail investors, and SPACs went out, and they were largely shitty

361
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,660
companies, and a lot of retail investors lost a lot of money.

362
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,580
The demand from retail, and who do you invest, if you're a retail investor that wants exposure

363
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,020
to AI, where do you invest right now?

364
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,500
It's basically Microsoft or NVIDIA.

365
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,520
What else do you invest in?

366
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,080
That's it.

367
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:45,640
There's so much demand for an NVIDIA-like competitor, even if it's a distant, distant,

368
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,980
distant number five, that there's a market for it.

369
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,620
Now, the first sign is that Barclays and Citi are not tier one.

370
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,700
Let me be clear, Barclays and Citi are the underwriters of this IPO.

371
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,620
Yeah, they're the underwriters.

372
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,440
So what that says is Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs said no.

373
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,520
Otherwise, one of those guys would be on the cover, which isn't to say it isn't a good

374
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,480
company, which isn't to say that it won't get a good reception in the marketplace, but

375
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,580
that's sort of the first, I don't want to call it a red flag, but the first indicator

376
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:15,860
here.

377
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:23,880
The red flag that is the size of Kansas here is that 87% of its revenues come from a company

378
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:31,720
backed by, I think, the UAE that is building its own LLM that also owns or has the opportunity

379
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,880
to buy shares in the company.

380
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,540
I mean, it's kind of a related party conflict, overly concentrated customer base that is the

381
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,580
stuff of nightmares.

382
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,440
Having said that, I would like to invest.

383
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,620
Whoever, I mean, there's a couple of reasons I'd like to invest.

384
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,380
I like the idea of bringing attention, sunlight, and capital to anything in this space that is

385
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,580
not NVIDIA or OpenAI.

386
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,400
It would be great for other competitors to emerge.

387
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,600
So I would love to be supportive of this company.

388
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,380
I want to follow it.

389
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,400
I want to talk about it.

390
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,180
I want to water as many new companies in this space as possible such that it just doesn't

391
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,460
develop into the Wintel, only much more concentrated.

392
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:20,560
The second is, I just think there's a decent chance this company gets an enormous pop because,

393
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,120
oh, it's AI.

394
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,860
Oh, it's a competitor to NVIDIA.

395
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,300
NVIDIA.

396
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,960
Sure, I'll throw some money at it.

397
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,240
And it's going to go out at a $7 billion market cap.

398
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,920
Say there's a one in 50 chance it becomes a quarter of NVIDIA.

399
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,280
Well, that would be $750 billion.

400
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,820
That would be, I mean, do the math.

401
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,180
That's still an okay investment.

402
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:49,060
So this is a lottery ticket, but it's a lottery ticket on the super, super, whatever it's called,

403
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,100
the super jackpot or the Powerball that all of a sudden we woke up and it's like, it's

404
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,080
$1.1 billion.

405
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,940
The prize here is so enormous for anybody that establishes momentum and traction.

406
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,820
So it's not the ilk.

407
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,920
It's not the pedigree you'd want in a company like this right now.

408
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,620
I wouldn't be surprised if the thing doubles on its first trade.

409
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,480
Well, I find it interesting that they're almost borrowing marketing tactics from the fast food

410
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:14,900
industry.

411
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:24,820
And that is, you know, when Burger King sales start slowing, a very surefire way to stoke

412
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:31,600
demand and interest in the company is to come out with a triple whopper or a double king XL.

413
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,980
Basically just create a fun size item of the product that you're already selling.

414
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,280
So having said that, I'm just going to read you some of the main details from the S1.

415
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:49,520
The first page in gigantic font, it takes up the entire page, says, quote, bigger chips are

416
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,600
faster and more efficient for AI.

417
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:58,380
In the prospectus summary, quote, the third generation Cerebrus wafer scale engine is the

418
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,140
largest chip ever sold.

419
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,640
It is 57 times larger than the leading commercially available GPU.

420
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,120
It has 52 times more compute cores, 880 times more on chip memory and 7000 times more memory

421
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,540
bandwidth.

422
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:19,500
The sheer size of the wafer scale chip allows us to keep more work on silicon and minimize

423
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,320
the time consuming power hungry movement of data.

424
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,520
In other words, the sales pitch is that size matters.

425
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,740
That's basically it.

426
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,940
But then again, they also say that it's 20 times faster than NVIDIA's chips.

427
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:39,460
And to your point, you know, if it's a good marketing tactic, maybe that's all that matters.

428
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,800
Maybe people read that.

429
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,900
They hear how big this chip is and they think, this is great.

430
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,840
We want to get involved.

431
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,000
So I'm sort of find it a little bit ridiculous parts of this.

432
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,160
I'm certainly concerned about that 87% number going to one company.

433
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,480
But there is an argument to be made that this kind of stuff could work and coming out with

434
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,500
fun-sized AI could generate the momentum they need to actually do well in the stock market.

435
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,260
If they can do anything, if ends up that any of their IP, any of their niches, if defense

436
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:19,140
contractors or pharmaceutical firms find that this monster, supersized chip works for them,

437
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,720
it's going to be worth a lot more than $7 billion.

438
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,580
So this is highly volatile.

439
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,040
But the upside here is asymmetric.

440
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,280
Yeah, it's like a mean stock play.

441
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:29,700
Yeah.

442
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,200
I could easily see this thing on any signs of life going to $30, $40, or $50 billion.

443
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,540
7x versus, assume the downside is zero.

444
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,620
But we should be clear, this is not at all value investing.

445
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,500
This is not based on the fundamentals.

446
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,940
And I do want to get your take on the fundamentals.

447
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,960
So they did $136 million in the first half of this year.

448
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,560
That number is up 15-fold from the previous year.

449
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,780
However, as we pointed out, 87% of that revenue is coming from one company, and that is G42.

450
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,200
And just I want to get your take a little bit on G42.

451
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,100
So this is an AI holding company that is based in Abu Dhabi.

452
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,860
They do AI everything.

453
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,980
I mean, the website, it says AI research, AI cloud computing, AI data centers, AI healthcare,

454
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,840
investing, et cetera, et cetera.

455
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,780
And they are largely controlled by the royal family of Abu Dhabi,

456
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,800
and largely funded by the UAE Sovereign Wealth Fund.

457
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,880
My instinct when I see these kinds of companies

458
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,980
is that this is very rich people who don't really know what they're doing.

459
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,880
Another word for that is, another term for that is dumb money.

460
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:47,040
You know, people who have more money than they even know what to do with.

461
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,200
That is my instinct.

462
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:54,340
Having said that, though, Microsoft is also a significant investor in G42.

463
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,580
They have partnerships going on with OpenAI and Dell and IBM and Microsoft.

464
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,580
They could be legit.

465
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,720
But my question to you would be, is the fact that their biggest client,

466
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,720
a Middle Eastern royalty-backed holding company,

467
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,940
is that good, bad, or does it not matter?

468
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,840
Okay, so there's some good and there's some bad.

469
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,940
So let's talk about the bad.

470
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,960
Related party transactions in 1999 and 2007,

471
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,820
when I was starting my tech companies,

472
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,420
what we found is that basically it was,

473
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,780
if you had a software company or even brand strategy,

474
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,540
my firm Profit,

475
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,160
in 99 we were killing it because there were all of these startups

476
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,540
who needed a brand identity and a logo and a strategy

477
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,000
and a positioning and a website.

478
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,160
So it was just champagne and cocaine.

479
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,500
When the market collapsed in 2000,

480
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,200
just all of our new clients dried up

481
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,120
because all of the new guys were gone.

482
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,700
They just got swept off the decks.

483
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,480
And a lot of times you found that all these new software startups,

484
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,400
Broadcom and all this e-commerce shit we were buying,

485
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,200
they were selling to all these hundreds or thousands of e-commerce startups

486
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,360
and then overnight, 60% of them were gone.

487
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,760
We were kind of all selling software and shit to each other

488
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,420
in the kind of the new brave world of the ecosystem.

489
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:13,200
There are so many new AI startups that the fear is,

490
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,320
okay, if there's a chill here,

491
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,940
these guys get swept off the deck first.

492
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:22,380
The scariest thing here is the concentration of one client, right?

493
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,620
Now, having said that,

494
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,380
you can imagine that the Gulf and the entire world looks at the amount,

495
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,760
it looks at this sector and says,

496
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,820
this is going to be probably the sector that creates the most shareholder value,

497
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,560
the quickest in a long, long time.

498
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,080
And it really bums us out that 97% of it is in one nation

499
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,540
and 80% of it or 70% of it isn't with a seven mile radius

500
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,780
of SFO International Airport.

501
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,760
And as we try and transition, we being the Gulf states or the UAE in this case,

502
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:54,180
from a fossil fuel-based economy to a services, tech, hospitality, education,

503
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,180
and in this instance, you know, technology-based economy,

504
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,320
we would like to have a presence in AI.

505
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,280
So the related party transaction here is really uncomfortable.

506
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,020
Having said that, when your related party has the deepest pockets in the world,

507
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,780
it's kind of a good related party.

508
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,340
And they'll be very supportive of the company moving forward

509
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,340
because they would like to see the center of gravity,

510
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,100
at least a little bit around AI, move into that region.

511
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,320
So red flags, red flags everywhere.

512
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,560
I'm a buyer.

513
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,840
Yeah, just one final comment from me on these sovereign wealth funds.

514
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,760
The public investment fund, which is Saudi Arabia,

515
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,080
Mubadala, which is UAE,

516
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:40,200
these funds, in my view, are the most susceptible to bullshit.

517
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,800
They are not disciples of the boring is sexy argument which you have made.

518
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,460
These are people who invest hundreds of billions of dollars

519
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,040
into whatever is the technology du jour.

520
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,100
They'll invest billions into buying Premier League teams.

521
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,100
They're building cities that have artificial moons.

522
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,940
I mean, these people love sexy stuff.

523
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,220
And so the idea that there is a company

524
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:09,300
that is pitching the world's biggest GPU cluster,

525
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm just not at all surprised that the biggest backer

526
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,700
is someone in the Gulf with a shit ton of oil money.

527
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,120
What I have found, the worst thing they could have done for their brand

528
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,340
was this brand called Masayoshi Son.

529
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,260
And that is the whole WeWork fiasco,

530
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,660
SoftBank got this reputation for coming in

531
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,540
and just overfunding stupid fucking ideas.

532
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,340
And it's tightly linked to this,

533
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,680
what you would describe as dumb money in the Gulf.

534
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,420
If you spend any time in the Gulf

535
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,720
and you spend any time with these guys,

536
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,460
I would argue on average,

537
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,420
they are more professionally managed

538
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,700
than the majority of VC hedge funds in the West.

539
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,160
I mean, a rookie move is if you meet a new VC or fund

540
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,920
and they think they're going to fly into Riyadh

541
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,300
and just like hold out a hat

542
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,560
and that billions of dollars is going to drop into their fund.

543
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,220
They're in for a rude awakening.

544
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,380
That's what's happening, no?

545
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:01,860
No.

546
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,180
I feel like those are the head...

547
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,180
Fair enough.

548
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,640
I don't experience it personally.

549
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,720
But what I certainly see in the headlines

550
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,780
is that you take a flight,

551
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,100
you have your brand,

552
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,480
you hold your hat out

553
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,980
and they dump billions of dollars in.

554
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,140
Oh, no, no, no, no.

555
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,060
For every fund that's raising money there,

556
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,340
there are a hundred going there

557
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,900
and going to a cool resort in the desert

558
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,260
and going to the Superfund conference

559
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,720
and then coming back with no money.

560
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,480
As a matter of fact,

561
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,460
they've switched their objective

562
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,640
to no longer letting money leave the region.

563
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,280
But what they want is what's in it for us.

564
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,660
We need to get...

565
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,660
We want to create jobs.

566
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,280
We want to...

567
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,740
We know we're running out of oil.

568
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,860
We don't know if it's 40 years or 70 years,

569
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,080
but we know we're running out of it.

570
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,300
So we need to make this transition.

571
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,360
And the transition is not only making money abroad,

572
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,860
but it's building sustainable industry here.

573
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,340
They're trying to build a huge industry

574
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,220
and even a city focusing on gaming,

575
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,500
you know, video games.

576
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,900
They're building huge universities.

577
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,280
NYU has a huge presence in Abu Dhabi.

578
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,460
I think it's a little bit reductive

579
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,500
and I don't know.

580
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,500
I think you're falling into the trap

581
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,620
of believing that you've seen the headlines

582
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,860
and the stories and the...

583
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,920
They've made bad investments.

584
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,120
Oh, no doubt.

585
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,680
But I also think they've made good investments.

586
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,140
And my experience with them has been

587
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,540
that they are just as,

588
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,580
if not more sophisticated

589
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,860
than any other alternative investments investor.

590
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,000
Anyways, come to Riyadh.

591
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,000
You and I are going to Riyadh.

592
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,640
Yeah, exactly.

593
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,900
I think that's where we're headed here.

594
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,900
I think either MBS is in the room with you

595
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,740
with a gun to your head

596
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,020
or we're going to get them on the podcast.

597
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,180
One of those two things is going to happen.

598
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,860
Neither of those is true.

599
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,840
And I want to be clear,

600
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,720
I have no investments

601
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,640
or vested interest in the golf right now.

602
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,540
Just to be clear.

603
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,420
Just to be clear.

604
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,200
We'll look into that.

605
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,700
We'll be right back after the break

606
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,720
with a look at the path forward for Nike.

607
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:10,380
It's taken a few months,

608
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,220
but I think I've almost chosen our next car.

609
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,960
I've weighed up new versus secondhand,

610
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,200
assessed the depreciation rates

611
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,780
and spoken to eight insurance providers.

612
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,560
I'll be ready to enter phase two of selection

613
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,580
over the next few weeks.

614
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,700
You might be a driving enthusiast,

615
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,880
but we're not all admin enthusiasts.

Welcome to the world.

641
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,920
Please read your personal owner's manual thoroughly.

642
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,800
In it, you'll find simple instructions

643

Thank you

648
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,740
and have a nice life.

649
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:22,660
Unfortunately,

650
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,180
life doesn't come

651
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,220
with an owner's manual.

652
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,480

661
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,820
We're back with Proftary Markets.

662
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,300
Nike withdrew its full-year sales guidance

663
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,040
ahead of its new CEO's arrival

664
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,880
later this month.

665
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,460
The company also postponed

666
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,320
its investor day,

667
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,980
signaling that a meaningful turnaround

668
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,100
will take some time

669
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,720
and the stock fell 7%.

670
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,700
As we discussed previously,

671
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,280
Nike tapped company veteran Elliot Hill

672
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,340
to take the helm

673
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,340
amid declining sales.

674
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,100
Revenue for the most recent quarter

675
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,180
dropped 10% year over year.

676
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,120
CFO Matthew Friend

677
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,260
said pulling the guidance

678
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,900
would give Hill

679
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,260
quote,

680
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,500
much needed flexibility

681
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,260
to evaluate Nike strategies

682
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,520
and business trends.

683
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:17,820
Scott,

684
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,000
based on your experience,

685
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,960
one,

686
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,640
what do you make of

687
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
these Nike earnings,

688
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,620
revenue down 10%?

689
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,180
And two,

690
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,140
what do you think

691
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,000
the new CEO,

692
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,740
Elliot Hill,

693
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,780
needs to do here

694
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,980
to stage a comeback

695
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,400
for Nike?

696
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:30,900
You know,

697
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,880
I like this company so much.

698
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,860
I have a bias.

699
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,180
I want you to go first,

700
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:35,380
Ed.

701
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
I think you probably have,

702
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,000
I mean,

703
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,140
you know,

704
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,480
unlike your exceptionally

705
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
biased bordering

706
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,700
on racist views

707
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,380
of the Gulf,

708
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,220
I'd like your views

709
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,360
on Nike on the swoosh.

710
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,840
And by the way,

711
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,100
they're really nice white people.

712
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,720
Go ahead.

713
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,760
No one's going to buy this.

714
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,300
No one's going to buy

715
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,260
the reason I believe

716
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,760
that they're investing

717
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,100
in these companies

718
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,640
because I'm racist.

719
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,420
Anyways,

720
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,020
go ahead.

721
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,180
What do you think of Nike?

722
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:03,980
Well,

723
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,880
I think what's interesting

724
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,480
is that,

725
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:05,860
you know,

726
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,620
there's not one part

727
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,600
of the business here

728
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,020
that is working.

729
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,860
It's basically bad

730
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,600
across the board.

731
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,320
So you're seeing

732
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,480
revenue declines

733
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,440
in direct revenue,

734
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,400
in brand revenue,

735
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,340
in wholesale revenue.

736
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,440
You're also seeing

737
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,420
revenue declines

738
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,960
across every region.

739
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,980
So it's down 11%

740
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,640
in North America.

741
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,660
It's down 13% in Europe.

742
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,160
The slowest decrease

743
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,240
was in China,

744
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,500
which is down 4%.

745
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,620
But that's sort of

746
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,600
the rising tide

747
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,260
with all boats

748
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,920
as we're seeing,

749
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,740
you know,

750
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,520
China is somewhat improving

751
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,040
or at least it's falling

752
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,860
less fast than it was before.

753
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,120
So the financial picture

754
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,540
for Nike is very simple.

755
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,180
Things are just bad

756
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,260
across the board.

757
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,620
The only other

758
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,620
interesting detail

759
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,240
is the fact

760
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:48,840
that they decided

761
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,480
to withdraw

762
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,160
their full year guidance,

763
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:51,980
i.e.

764
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,260
their financial forecast

765
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,380
for the next 12 months.

766
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,200
And instead,

767
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:55,900
they're only offering

768
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,660
quarterly forecasting.

769
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,840
And their explanation

770
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,380
for that

771
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,120
is that,

772
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:00,340
you know,

773
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,500
we have a management shakeup,

774
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,380
we've got a new CEO,

775
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,060
we're in a transition period.

776
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,420
I can't tell if that is

777
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,060
an appropriate excuse or not.

778
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,300
So I would like to get

779
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,240
your take on that.

780
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,740
What do you make of a company

781
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,400
like Nike,

782
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,560
as big as Nike,

783
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,500
saying,

784
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,640
we actually don't know

785
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,740
what the next 12 months

786
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,660
looks like

787
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,260
because we've got

788
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,860
a new CEO coming in.

789
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,800
Is that a valid excuse

790
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,200
or is it a little bit bullshit?

791
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,460
I think it's the latter.

792
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,480
I think when you're a company

793
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:26,960
like Nike,

794
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,240
you should have such a deep bench,

795
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,240
you should have such

796
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,340
a talented CFO,

797
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,080
you should be able to draw

798
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,680
on such an incredibly talented CEO,

799
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,400
which I think

800
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,440
the new CEO is,

801
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,880
that you should be able

802
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,920
to handle learnings calls

803
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,260
and forward-looking projections.

804
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,920
So if you really feel that way,

805
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,440
that you need to free up,

806
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,960
the excuse they gave

807
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,200
that it would essentially,

808
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,900
what was it said?

809
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,120
That it would much need

810
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,140
a flexibility to evaluate

811
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,860
Nike's strategy

812
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,480
and business trends.

813
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,560
That's why companies

814
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,440
are taken private

815
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,420
because when you have

816
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,180
a public company,

817
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,000
you're sort of promising

818
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,700
that you're going to give

819
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,780
a certain level of transparency,

820
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,700
especially when you're

821
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,180
an S&P company like Nike.

822
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,400
So that is yet another signal

823
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,260
that these guys really

824
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,400
don't have their shit together.

825
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,840
And even if you were

826
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,600
to come on and say,

827
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,060
I'm new,

828
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,940
this is what I'm thinking,

829
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,280
and have the CFO report

830
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,040
in a very no mercy,

831
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,880
no malice way,

832
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:17,960
you know,

833
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,820
this is what's going on,

834
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,980
I think analysts would be fine.

835
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,440
But to kind of go back

836
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,360
into we don't know

837
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,240
what's going on,

838
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,060
we want the freedom

839
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,980
to figure this out,

840
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:26,780
come on,

841
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,640
you're fucking Nike,

842
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,640
for God's sakes.

843
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,680
You should have that.

844
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,740
You should have five people

845
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,620
sitting around the table

846
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,140
that could probably be the CEO

847
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,000
in the earnings call

848
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,260
for the next two or three quarters

849
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,280
that are just very good

850
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:38,900
at what they do.

851
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,820
And the fact that

852
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,840
they don't have that,

853
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,300
it reflects poorly

854
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:42,960
on the board

855
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,320
and the bench,

856
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:45,880
if you will.

857
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:46,500
Now,

858
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,460
down 10%

859
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,900
on a company this size

860
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,040
is no doubt,

861
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,460
that is nearly a meltdown

862
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,360
for a company like this

863
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,220
that is so diversified

864
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,020
around the globe.

865
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,240
I wonder if this was

866
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,540
a bit of a kitchen sink quarter,

867
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,120
if they kind of threw

868
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,280
all their bad news in here.

869
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,700
What do they need to do?

870
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,200
I'd be very curious to know,

871
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:04,720
and you never like

872
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,400
to say this out loud,

873
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,380
I'd be very curious to know

874
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:06,920
what their revenue

875
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,840
per employee is.

876
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,700
It feels to me like

877
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,840
a pretty significant

878
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,760
layoff is coming.

879
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,620
But what they need to show

880
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,120
is some momentum

881
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,560
around shrinking

882
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,920
the product development time

883
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,080
and getting kind of,

884
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:20,520
if you will,

885
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,480
I don't want to say cool again,

886
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,600
but on trend again,

887
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,020
getting out there

888
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,760
and getting much more

889
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,860
in touch at a ground level

890
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,380
with some of their

891
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,120
cooler, smaller retailers

892
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,820
being more on trend.

893
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:30,420
And then once they

894
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,260
discover trends,

895
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,680
getting stuff from design

896
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,300
or concept to shelf

897
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,220
much faster.

898
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,980
And I think they should

899
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,100
be able to figure that out.

900
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,520
Also,

901
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,040
they've just left

902
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,720
these niches

903
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,840
and these doors wide open

904
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,300
for Hoka and for On.

905
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:45,800
At the end of the day,

906
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,220
I agree with you.

907
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,620
They shouldn't be saying,

908
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:48,940
oh,

909
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,940
we're in such disarray

910
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,960
that we're not going

911
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,920
to be able to do it

912
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,120
basically every public company.

913
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,480
97% of public companies

914
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,580
managed to do this

915
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,820
and none of them have the,

916
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,060
or very few of them

917
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:02,880
have the resources

918
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,080
and the depth of the bench

919
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,440
of a Nike.

920
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,620
So I just think this brand

921
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,140
is just,

922
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,980
I don't care where you go.

923
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:10,560
I don't care if you go

924
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,380
to Cape Town

925
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,580
or Seoul

926
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,300
or, you know,

927
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,900
Cambodia.

928
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,520
11-year-olds

929
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,460
playing football

930
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,180
in the yard

931
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,200
are wearing Nike

932
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,360
and the brand

933
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,580
has always reinvented itself.

934
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,080
They have such

935
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,440
powerful marketing roots.

936
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,520
They're not even

937
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,680
needed to reinvent itself.

938
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,620
It just resonates

939
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,640
so deeply

940
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,940
that I,

941
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,060
I like this company a lot.

942
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:34,760
I think at these

943
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,580
price levels,

944
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,700
I mean,

945
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,300
I'd be prepared

946
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,280
for it to go down more,

947
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,200
but this is,

948
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:39,600
you know,

949
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,180
I'm thinking about

950
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:40,880
setting up a trust

951
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,580
for my kids

952
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,720
and this is one

953
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,380
of those stocks

954
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,480
that I would put in there

955
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:44,900
and just say,

956
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,120
okay,

957
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,640
look at it in 20 years.

958
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,520
Two things

959
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,540
I find quite interesting.

960
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,100
One is,

961
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,660
I think you're right

962
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,600
that the CFO

963
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,340
kind of did a shitty job here

964
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,720
and the rest

965
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,620
of the management team

966
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,100
while the previous CEO,

967
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,720
John Donahoe,

968
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,200
is out.

969
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,740
And it sort of reminds me

970
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,980
of like the Gareth Southgate

971
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,540
problem

972
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,820
where we have this tendency

973
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,880
to just assume

974
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,040
that everything's going bad

975
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,600
because the head honcho sucks.

976
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,160
And now the head honcho's out

977
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,180
and we're seeing

978
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:13,920
that maybe actually

979
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,140
the rest of the management team

980
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:15,660
sucks too.

981
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,540
Maybe the players

982
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,620
on the field

983
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,820
are not performing

984
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,680
as well as they should.

985
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,160
But we're so obsessed

986
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,720
with blaming the manager,

987
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,260
in this case,

988
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,180
the England manager,

989
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:25,760
or in this case,

990
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,560
the Nike CEO,

991
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,420
that we just get

992
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,460
so caught up with that.

993
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,240
And then when they leave,

994
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:31,500
we're like,

995
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,440
oh, maybe it's an us problem

996
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,760
that we didn't realize.

997
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,860
The second thing

998
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,820
that I find kind of interesting,

999
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:37,680
what you're saying

1000
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,360
about the brand

1001
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,460
and how strong it is,

1002
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,780
we often hear this idea

1003
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,340
of brand as moat,

1004
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,480
that if you have

1005
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,560
a strong brand,

1006
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,200
it can act as

1007
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,900
a really strong moat

1008
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,560
to prevent competition

1009
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,520
from your competitors.

1010
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,560
And, you know,

1011
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,340
10 years ago,

1012
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,200
I feel like we would have

1013
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,000
used Nike

1014
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,340
as the shining example of this.

1015
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:58,840
We would have said,

1016
00:46:59,280 --> 00:46:59,580
you know,

1017
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,760
Nike is far and away

1018
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,160
the winner.

1019
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,260
It has a huge moat

1020
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,080
because it has

1021
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,260
such a strong brand.

1022
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,440
But I look at what's

1023
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,520
happened in Nike here

1024
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,960
and I look at what's

1025
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,720
happened to a lot of

1026
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,900
other iconic brands

1027
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,780
recently that you

1028
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,580
have been talking about

1029
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,260
and that you've

1030
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,440
written about in your blog.

1031
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,900
Starbucks, for example,

1032
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:16,880
Disney,

1033
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,520
down more than 25%

1034
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,380
in the past five years.

1035
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,520
Estee Lauder,

1036
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,440
basically cut in half

1037
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,420
over the past five years.

1038
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:25,840
And it feels like

1039
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,340
at this point,

1040
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,140
you could maybe

1041
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,480
make the opposite case,

1042
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,640
which is that,

1043
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:30,260
you know,

1044
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,140
a strong brand,

1045
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,060
when it's strong,

1046
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,180
looks like a moat

1047
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,340
until eventually it isn't.

1048
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,960
Because what looks like

1049
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,160
might be happening

1050
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,440
is that these companies

1051
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,820
have become so reliant

1052
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,660
and so dependent

1053
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,540
on their brand

1054
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,260
that it ends up

1055
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,320
being their downfall.

1056
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,040
They think that

1057
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:47,760
they're invincible

1058
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,380
because we're Nike,

1059
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,980
because we're Estee Lauder.

1060
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,480
Who could come after us?

1061
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,780
It's an interesting observation.

1062
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:54,800
And that is,

1063
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,180
so the algorithm

1064
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,240
for printing money

1065
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,620
from the end of World War II

1066
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,680
to the introduction of Google

1067
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,160
has come up

1068
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,180
with a mediocre product,

1069
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,180
a mediocre car,

1070
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,520
salty snack,

1071
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,480
mediocre shoe,

1072
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,440
mediocre carbonated drink,

1073
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,880
and then wrap it

1074
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,360
in these amazing brand codes

1075
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,360
of youth, masculinity,

1076
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,560
European elegance,

1077
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,560
sex appeal,

1078
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,500
and use this incredibly

1079
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,200
cheap medium,

1080
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:17,720
we didn't realize

1081
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,540
how cheap it was,

1082
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,120
called broadcast media

1083
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,120
where all of America

1084
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:21,600
was watching

1085
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,420
one of three channels

1086
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,600
and just pound away

1087
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,060
at these associations

1088
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,200
and people would pay

1089
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:26,700
two bucks

1090
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,420
for 20 cents

1091
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,280
a peanut butter paste

1092
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:28,840
because it meant

1093
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,860
that you loved your kids more

1094
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,380
because choosing moms

1095
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,140
chose Jeff

1096
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,680
or that I was

1097
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,620
a more competitive,

1098
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,760
strong, masculine,

1099
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,380
individual American person

1100
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,040
if I bought

1101
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,300
$210 Air Jordans.

1102
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,580
Since the introduction

1103
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,220
of Google,

1104
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,840
the rise of quality

1105
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,440
and innovation

1106
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,280
has just been dramatic

1107
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:47,800
and the example

1108
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,960
I use is hotels.

1109
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,900
Whenever I traveled

1110
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,760
and I've been traveling

1111
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,860
180 to 220 days a year

1112
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,820
for the last 30 years,

1113
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,260
I would stay

1114
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,100
at the Four Seasons

1115
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,600
with a Mandarin Oriental.

1116
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,980
One, because someone else

1117
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,560
was paying

1118
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,180
and two,

1119
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,240
they were always an eight.

1120
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,180
On a scale of one to ten,

1121
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:02,860
they were always an eight.

1122
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,540
And if I was in Madrid,

1123
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,140
I didn't have the time

1124
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:06,740
or the insight

1125
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,680
to figure out

1126
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,760
is there a better hotel

1127
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,900
than the Madrid Four Seasons,

1128
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,380
which I know

1129
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,080
is going to be lovely.

1130
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,720
Now with the introduction

1131
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,260
of Google,

1132
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,280
TripAdvisor,

1133
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,380
your social graph,

1134
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:15,920
Instagram,

1135
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,660
within about five minutes,

1136
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,540
I can figure out

1137
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,860
the Rosewood Villa Magna

1138
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:20,740
is absolutely

1139
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,020
where I want to stay

1140
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,220
in Madrid.

1141
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:23,860
I mean,

1142
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,580
that's just it.

1143
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,260
Or when I'm in Sao Paulo,

1144
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,220
yeah, the Four Seasons

1145
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:27,600
would be great,

1146
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,320
but again,

1147
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:28,660
actually,

1148
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,320
the Rosewood there

1149
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:29,740
is probably,

1150
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,240
in my opinion,

1151
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,040
the best hotel

1152
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,400
in the world.

1153
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,240
It's the Faena

1154
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,780
in South Beach.

1155
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,760
And people can figure

1156
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,320
it out now.

1157
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,140
So it sounds passe,

1158
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:38,900
but all of a sudden,

1159
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,120
product and innovation

1160
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,960
are the new bomb.

1161
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,600
And the notion

1162
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,460
that you're putting forward

1163
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,400
that they got too reliant

1164
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:45,900
on the mode

1165
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:46,660
of the Nike brand

1166
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,220
and not focused

1167
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,340
enough on new product,

1168
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,240
new innovation,

1169
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,560
new marketing channels,

1170
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,360
I think that's a worthwhile

1171
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,860
or a fair criticism.

1172
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,260
But having said that,

1173
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:00,760
there are certain brands

1174
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,520
and certain items

1175
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,520
where brand plays

1176
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,400
a bigger role.

1177
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,780
You are a Panerai,

1178
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,320
it means you're having

1179
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,120
a midlife crisis,

1180
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:06,860
maybe a little bit

1181
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,680
of erectile dysfunction,

1182
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,300
have a little bit

1183
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:08,620
of money.

1184
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,680
But if you have sex

1185
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,120
with me,

1186
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,800
if we have kids,

1187
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,720
your kids are more likely

1188
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,420
to survive

1189
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,120
than if you...

1190
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,900
That's what everyone thinks.

1191
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,380
Exactly.

1192
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,020
Then if you have...

1193
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,780
Just go with it.

1194
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,840
Then if you have sex

1195
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,240
with Ed,

1196
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:26,620
who's wearing

1197
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,680
a fucking swatch watch.

1198
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,300
So your watch,

1199
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,560
your watch,

1200
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,220
the degree you got

1201
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,060
from college,

1202
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:34,520
the only reason

1203
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,260
your girlfriend's with you

1204
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:35,700
is because she heard

1205
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,720
you went to Princeton, Ed.

1206
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,260
I've already spoken

1207
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:37,900
to her about this.

1208
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,100
Your car,

1209
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,960
and also your shoes

1210
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,080
are really powerful forms

1211
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,380
of self-expressive benefit.

1212
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,500
And the self-expressive benefit

1213
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,200
of Nike that registers

1214
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,360
across two, three,

1215
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,600
probably four million consumers

1216
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,260
around the world

1217
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,440
is still unbelievable.

1218
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,380
Translates unbelievable margin.

1219
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,440
But the brand era,

1220
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,300
I agree with you,

1221
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,060
the brand era

1222
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,420
is officially over.

1223
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:03,260
I don't know

1224
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:03,760
if you'd call it

1225
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,900
the supply chain era

1226
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,840
or the innovation era,

1227
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,500
but the way you communicate

1228
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,700
a better supply chain

1229
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,620
or the vessel

1230
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,280
for communication

1231
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,040
for supply chain

1232
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,480
or innovation

1233
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,960
is still the brand

1234
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,300
and the logo.

1235
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,600
Anything that's on HBO,

1236
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,600
I'll trial.

1237
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,740
A big thing,

1238
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,040
a big show

1239
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,980
coming from HBO,

1240
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:20,400
I'm like,

1241
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,280
oh, I'll watch it

1242
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,620
because they just have

1243
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,300
a finer filter.

1244
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,760
Any hotel from Rosewood,

1245
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,580
I will try

1246
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,780
because it does have,

1247
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,380
in my opinion,

1248
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:29,740
a finer filter.

1249
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,740
Now, does that mean

1250
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,480
brand is as big a moat?

1251
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,400
Absolutely not

1252
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,200
because I have my,

1253
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:34,820
I have Instagram,

1254
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,140
I have my social graph.

1255
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,440
So what you're saying

1256
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,340
holds true.

1257
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,420
A company like Nike

1258
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:40,720
can,

1259
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,560
if it's not careful,

1260
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,900
fall further faster.

1261
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,780
But just based on

1262
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,460
that base of awareness

1263
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,820
and aspirational value

1264
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,040
and self-expressive benefit,

1265
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,360
they have just tons

1266
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:51,980
of permission.

1267
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,260
If they come out

1268
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,060
with a decent product line,

1269
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,220
you're going to,

1270
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,240
I think you're going to see

1271
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,080
those revenues

1272
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,460
start to pop again.

1273
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:00,220
Yeah,

1274
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,020
I think that's right.

1275
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:01,600
Let's take a look

1276
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,120
at the week ahead.

1277
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,260
We'll see the consumer price

1278
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,320
and producer price indices

1279
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:06,920
for September

1280
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,140
and third quarter

1281
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,320
earnings season kicks off

1282
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,460
with JV Morgan,

1283
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,480
Wells Fargo,

1284
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,660
and BlackRock

1285
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,480
all reporting.

1286
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:14,620
Scott,

1287
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,060
do you have any

1288
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,800
predictions for us?

1289
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,520
Well, just based on

1290
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,120
what you said,

1291
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,100
I do think there's a,

1292
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,300
I think churn

1293
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,200
is really important

1294
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,200
and I'd like to think

1295
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,060
there's some churn

1296
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,480
going on right now.

1297
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:23,980
Companies like

1298
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:24,440
Starbucks,

1299
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,420
Intel,

1300
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:26,740
Disney,

1301
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,400
Nike,

1302
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:29,740
Estee Lauder,

1303
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,000
Warner Brothers,

1304
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,840
these companies are,

1305
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,660
as they should be,

1306
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,020
getting kicked in the nuts

1307
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,700
and that makes room

1308
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,640
for new competitors.

1309
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,620
I'd like to think,

1310
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,080
unfortunately,

1311
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:40,720
they're mostly being

1312
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,260
kicked in the butt

1313
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,980
by TikTok,

1314
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:43,940
but anyways,

1315
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
in a weak Chinese consumer.

1316
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,780
But you are seeing

1317
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,720
a changing of the guard.

1318
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,760
Too many old people

1319
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,780
running these companies.

1320
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,320
Too many old people

1321
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,120
who are getting paid

1322
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,300
too much fucking money

1323
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,560
for lackluster performance.

1324
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,740
So all super talented executives,

1325
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
but I would speculate

1326
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,220
that Bob Iger

1327
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,840
and David Zaslav

1328
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,880
are going to announce

1329
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,840
or at least put in place

1330
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,040
some sort of succession plan

1331
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,000
in the next year or two.

1332
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,200
These are people

1333
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,000
who are both great executives,

1334
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,100
especially Bob Iger.

1335
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,600
Zaslav has made

1336
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,640
a third of a billion dollars

1337
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,820
to lose 60,

1338
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,020
70% of his shareholders'

1339
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,460
valuation.

1340
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,120
And then the final one

1341
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,220
is I think Fabrizio Freda,

1342
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,640
the CEO at Estee Lauder.

1343
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,660
That company has shit the bed

1344
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,660
the last five years.

1345
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,460
They're probably due.

1346
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,600
He's had a great career,

1347
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,400
a storied career.

1348
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,320
He's made a lot of money.

1349
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,080
He deserves it.

1350
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,020
But I wouldn't be surprised

1351
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:39,800
if in the next

1352
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,980
three, six, 12 months,

1353
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:42,300
if you should get

1354
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:42,960
the timing right,

1355
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,720
we see succession strategies

1356
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,940
announced at Warner Brothers

1357
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,460
and Disney,

1358
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,140
and we see a new CEO

1359
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,200
at Estee Lauder Company.

1435
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:08,060


1436
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:08,060


1437
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:08,060


1438
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:08,380
Your kids

1439
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,080
Go to Princeton

1440
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:09,700
Does that help?

1441
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,980
How do custom orders

1442
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:14,780
work on Kraken?

1443
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,040
Imagine I'm a music producer

1444
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,540
dialing in my newest track.

1445
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:19,620
Need more bass?

1446
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:20,500
Crank it.

1447
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:21,800
Vocals not popping?

1448
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:22,880
Double it up.

1449
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,160
Want a bigger sound?

1450
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,620
Hit that reverb.

1451
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:26,480
Hard.

1452
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,100
That's custom orders

1453
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:28,580
on Kraken.

1454
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,600
Complete control

1455
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,640
over your crypto trades.

1456
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,240
Go to kraken.com

1457
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,540
and see what crypto can be.

1458
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,960
Don't invest

1459
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,540
unless you're prepared

1460
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,620
to lose all the money you invest.

1461
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:37,980
This is a high risk investment

1462
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,500
and you should not expect to be protected

1463
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,360
if something goes wrong.

1464
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,360
I'm Ashley C. Ford

1465
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,220
and I host

1466
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,100
Into the Mix,

1467
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,720
a Ben and Jerry's podcast

1468
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,420
about joy and justice

1469
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,980
produced with Vox Creative.

1470
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,480
We're back with new episodes

1471
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,220
taking a look at voter fraud,

1472
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,080
specifically how the fear

1473
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,560
of voter fraud accusations

1474
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,660
can lead to voter suppression.

1475
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,000
As the 2024 election

1476
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,060
draws nearer,

1477
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,860
former President Donald Trump

1478
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,080
continues to claim

1479
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,320
without evidence

1480
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,240
that widespread voter fraud

1481
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,400
lost him the election

1482
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,200
in 2020.

1483
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,020
So we wanted to know,

1484
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,700
how do claims like this

1485
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,360
affect ordinary voters?

1486
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:19,920
Hear the story

1487
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,940
of a civil servant

1488
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,520
who faced felony charges

1489
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,140
and years in prison

1490
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,060
for helping a first-time voter

1491
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:26,740
figure out

1492
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,380
how to use a voting machine.

1493
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,220
That story and more

1494
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,420
on Into the Mix,

1495
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,820
a Ben and Jerry's podcast.

1496
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,100
a Ben and Jerry's podcast.
