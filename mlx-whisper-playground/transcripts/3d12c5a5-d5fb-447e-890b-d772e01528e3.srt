00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
Welcome to the Tech Meme Right Home for Thursday, October 10th, 2024. I'm Brian McCullough. Today,

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,060
Apple TV Plus finally comes to prime video channels. OpenAI says they've been disrupting

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:20,220
AI election influence campaigns, but they won't be profitable until when? How Google plans to

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,120
beat the regulation rap and a review of basically the highest-end smartwatch you can buy. Here's

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,760
what you missed today in the world of tech.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,960
Amazon has announced that Apple TV Plus will soon be available as a $9.99 per month subscription

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,060
add-on in Prime video channels. That's coming later this month in the U.S., joining more than

8
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:49,420
100 streaming services already there, quoting Bloomberg. What we offer channel partners is

9
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,620
hundreds of millions of subscribers around the world. Amazon said having this engagement around

10
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,340
the world with Prime members, accessing Prime video is a real great platform for other partners to be

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,080
able to reach them, end quote. Amazon markets more than 100 streaming services via its channel's store,

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,820
enabling customers to watch shows from Max, Paramount Plus, and Hallmark within Prime video.

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,940
Those services rely on Amazon to expand their audience. Apple TV Plus was one of the only major

14
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,380
streaming services not available in the store, along with Netflix and Walt Disney's main properties.

15
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,640
Those two are among the few with streaming services that have more viewers than Prime video.

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,100
The agreement expands an existing relationship between the companies. In 2017, Amazon started

17
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:37,320
offering a Prime video app on the Apple TV set-top box, while Prime video is integrated into the Apple

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,800
TV app across the iPhone maker's device lineup. The two companies are also retail partners with Apple

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,840
offering an official store via Amazon.com, end quote.

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:58,440
OpenAI says it has disrupted more than 20 operations and deceptive networks so far this year that tried

21
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:04,140
to use its models for disinformation purposes, including four that had election-related content,

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,880
quoting CNBC. In a 54-page report published Wednesday, the chat GPT creator said that it's

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,260
disrupted, quote, more than 20 operations and deceptive networks from around the world

24
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,040
that attempted to use our models. The threats ranged from AI-generated website articles to social media

25
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,720
posts by fake accounts. The company said its update on influence and cyber operations was intended to

26
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,520
provide a snapshot of what it's seeing and to identify, quote, an initial set of trends that we believe

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,980
can inform debate on how AI fits into the broader threat landscape, end quote.

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,540
OpenAI's report lands less than a month before the U.S. presidential election, but beyond the U.S.,

29
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,640
it's a significant year for elections worldwide, with contests taking place that affect upward of 4

30
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,340
billion people in more than 40 countries. The rise of AI-generated content has led to serious

31
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,300
election-related misinformation concerns, with the number of deepfakes that have been created

32
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,380
increasing 900% year over year, according to data from Clarity, a machine learning firm.

33
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,160
OpenAI wrote in its report that election-related uses of AI, quote,

34
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,480
ranged in complexity from simple requests for content generation to complex multi-stage efforts

35
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,500
to analyze and reply to social media posts. The social media content related mostly to elections

36
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,000
in the U.S. and Rwanda, and to a lesser extent, elections in India and the EU, OpenAI said.

37
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,000
In late August, an Iranian operation used OpenAI's products to generate, quote,

38
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,900
long-form articles and social media comments about the U.S. election, as well as other topics,

39
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,240
but the company said the majority of identified posts received few or no likes, shares, or comments.

40
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,220
In July, the company banned ChatGPT accounts in Rwanda that were posting election-related comments

41
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,360
on X, and in May, an Israeli company used ChatGPT to generate social media comments about elections

42
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,820
in India. OpenAI wrote that it was able to address the case within less than 24 hours.

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,800
In June, OpenAI addressed a covert operation that used its products to generate comments about the

44
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,360
European Parliament elections in France and politics in the U.S., Germany, Italy, and Poland.

45
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,660
The company said that while most social media posts it identified received few likes or shares,

46
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,260
some real people did reply to the AI-generated posts. None of the election-related operations

47
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,880
were able to attract viral engagement or build sustained audiences via the use of ChatGPT

48
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,840
and OpenAI's other tools the company wrote, end quote.

49
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:30,220
Sticking with OpenAI for one more second, the information has seen internal documents from

50
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,620
OpenAI with projections suggesting that the company won't turn a profit until 2029 when its revenue

51
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:46,820
would hit $100 billion. Losses could hit $14 billion in 2026, up nearly 3x on this year.

52
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,760
So if true, number one, they need to hit $100 billion in revenue just to turn a profit. That

53
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,300
does suggest that margins aren't great. But number two, that level of cash burn suggests they have

54
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,000
a hell of a needle to thread. Quote,

55
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,140
This estimate doesn't include stock compensation, which is one of OpenAI's biggest expenses,

56
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,800
although not one it pays in cash. OpenAI is emphasizing to investors a metric of profitability

57
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,720
that excludes some major expenses, such as the billions it is spending annually on training its

58
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,980
large language models. The documents show, by that metric, OpenAI projects it will turn

59
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:27,840
profitable in 2026. The company last week completed a $6.6 billion funding round, valuing it at $157

60
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,520
billion. The documents, which include financial statements and forecasts, contain a number of

61
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,600
revelations about OpenAI that may change perceptions of the company's financial prospects.

62
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,340
OpenAI appears to be burning far less cash than previously thought. The company burned through

63
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,500
about $340 million in the first half of this year, leaving it with $1 billion in cash on the

64
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,240
balance sheet before the fundraising effort. But the cash burn could accelerate sharply in the next

65
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,720
couple of years, the documents suggest. There's a big gap between OpenAI's cash flow and its bottom

66
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,600
line, reflecting standard accounting differences in how it treats its major expenses, such as stock

67
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,220
compensation and compute credits in different financial statements. OpenAI calculated its net loss to be

68
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:13,080
$3 billion for the first half of the year. OpenAI expects to spend more than $200 billion through

69
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,820
the end of the decade, excluding stock compensation costs. Between 60 to 80% of its spending each year

70
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,120
would go toward either training or running the models. An analysis of the documents suggests that

71
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,220
OpenAI projects its total losses between 2023 and 2028, excluding stock compensation, will be $44 billion.

72
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,460
The same analysis suggests the company anticipates it will make $14 billion in profit on that basis in

73
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:45,220
2029. In the first half of this year, the company reported stock compensation of $1.5 billion, likely

74
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,820
equivalent to its revenue in the period. The documents imply that Microsoft gets a cut of 20% of OpenAI's

75
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,840
revenues, which is higher than previously thought. OpenAI is projecting that computing costs for model

76
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,140
training could rise sharply in the next couple of years to as high as $9.5 billion a year

77
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:07,720
in 2026. That's in addition to the amortized upfront costs of training for large language model research,

78
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,880
which its financial documents report as research compute costs spread out over a number of years.

79
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,320
That figure is also rising sharply to more than $5 billion in 2026 from a projected $1 billion this year.

80
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,220
Some of OpenAI's computing costs aren't paid in cash. Microsoft advanced OpenAI computing credits as part

81
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,280
of its $10 billion investment last year. And in the first half of this year, OpenAI recorded about

82
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,700
$500 million of data center lease expenses covered by Microsoft, according to the documents and a

83
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:41,080
person familiar with the matter. It's unclear how many computing credits OpenAI has left. It's likely,

84
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:47,820
however, that OpenAI will have to spend more of its own cash if it increases compute spending as much

85
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,320
as projected in the documents. OpenAI also has been discussing borrowing money to try to set up data

86
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,780
centers more quickly than Microsoft can, the information reported this week. Still, OpenAI could scale back

87
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,740
the compute spending, for instance, if upcoming models have more staying power than prior ones because

88
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,540
rivals aren't able to catch up quickly, or if the models are less costly to train because of future

89
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,040
breakthroughs. That would reduce the demands on its cash resources."

90
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:26,200
This makes me a tiny bit concerned about the Vision Pro. Sources say Dan Riccio, Apple's Vision Pro

91
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,040
chief and former senior vice president of hardware engineering is leaving Apple in October. The

92
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,560
Vision Pro team will now report to John Ternus, quoting Bloomberg.

93
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,540
Mike Rockwell, Riccio's current lieutenant, will continue to lead the Vision products group on a

94
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,840
day-to-day basis, said the people who asked not to be identified because the changes aren't public.

95
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,380
A spokesperson for the Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment.

96
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,400
Riccio's exit marks one of the most significant departures from Apple's management team,

97
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,460
though it's been in the making for some time. Three years ago, he switched from being a senior

98
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,480
vice president to a vice president and left the 12-person executive team a step toward his

99
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,340
eventual retirement. Riccio spoke at an event at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Wednesday,

100
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,740
telling students he is winding down his career at Apple. He said he wants to get more involved at

101
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,740
the engineering program named for him at the university, including by potentially teaching or

102
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,240
developing curriculum material. He also spoke about the birth of the original iMac and said the

103
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,260
iPhone X was the product he was most proud to create. The executive spent 26 years at the

104
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,580
company and was known at times for an abrasive style and controversial moves, but he also made

105
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,500
key hires and encouraged acquisitions that resulted in major new products. His tenure included overseeing

106
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,040
some of Apple's biggest bets, including development of the Vision Pro headset and the failed bid to make

107
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:55,300
a car." There's no shortage of helpful AI tools out there, but using them means switching back and

108
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,380
forth between yet another digital tool. So instead of simplifying your workflow, it just becomes more

109
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:06,160
complicated. Unless, of course, you're in Notion. The new Notion AI is a single AI tool that does it all.

110
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,400
You can search across Notion and other apps, generate docs in your own style, analyze PDFs and images,

111
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,280
and it will chat with you about anything. Notion AI is connected to multiple knowledge sources. It uses

112
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,580
AI knowledge from GPT-4 and Claude to chat with you about any topic. It can search across thousands of

113
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,900
Notion docs in seconds to quickly answer any question. And with AI connectors now in beta,

114
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,540
Notion AI can search across Slack, discussions, Google Docs, sheets, and slides,

115
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,180
and more tools like GitHub and Jira are coming soon. Unlike other specialized tools or legacy

116
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,640
suites that have you bouncing between six different apps, Notion is seamlessly integrated,

117
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,560
infinitely flexible, and beautifully easy to use. Try Notion for free when you go to

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,860
How do you make a password that's strong enough no one will be able to guess it, but also impossible

121
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,280
to forget? And how can you do that for a hundred different websites? And how can you make it so

122
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,660
everyone in your company can do the same without ever having the need to reset them? Sounds like

123
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,880
an impossible task unless you have 1Password. As I've said, I've been using 1Password for about 15 years.

124
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,680
I have it on every computer and phone I've had over that time. I used 1Password today. I used it like

125
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,460
three minutes ago. Companies lose hours every day just from employees forgetting and resetting passwords.

126
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,200
A single data breach costs millions of dollars, but 1Password secures every sign-in to save you time and money.

127
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,000
Any device, any time. 1Password lets you securely switch between iPhone, Android, Mac, and PC with

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:27,780
The Financial Times takes a look at how Google plans to deflect and delay that U.S. breakup threat

135
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:34,180
that we spoke about yesterday. A Remedies ruling is likely in mid-2025, but legal timelines may let it

136
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:41,100
put off any impact of that ruling for years. Quote, Google's initial response to the DOJ's proposals

137
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:47,060
that competition is thriving in search ads and fierce in artificial intelligence would have been less

138
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:53,340
convincing even two years ago before OpenAI's launch of the breakthrough chat GPT chatbot. Spinning out

139
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,540
its arguments through the appeals courts will be crucial to Google's strategy as it looks to deflect

140
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,140
or delay the effects of August's landmark ruling by a federal judge that it maintained an illegal

141
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,260
monopoly by paying billions of dollars to device makers, mobile carriers, and browser developers.

142
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,500
The legal timelines involved in such a complex and high-stakes case are likely to allow Google to put

143
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,920
off any impact on its business for years. It plans to appeal the liability decision when the judge rules

144
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,540
on remedies, which is likely to be in mid-2025, and may then also contest the remedies themselves.

145
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,560
Broadly, Google's argument focuses on what it describes as regulatory overreach following a case

146
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,440
about the impact of its distribution agreements. Forcing it to divest assets or share data with

147
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,860
competitors would, quote, go far beyond the specific legal issues in this case, it said in a blog post on

148
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,940
Tuesday. Requiring Google to split off its Chrome browser or Android operating system or other

149
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,840
structural remedies would, quote, tilt the field at the precise moment that competition is thriving,

150
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,460
the company said. With new search advertising competitors such as Amazon and TikTok emerging

151
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,760
and widespread disruption to its core business from AI startups, including OpenAI and perplexity,

152
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,420
Google can argue that it is facing the stiffest competition since Microsoft's Bing launched 15 years ago.

153
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,980
On Tuesday, for example, Google pointed to an e-marketer forecast that its share of U.S. search

154
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,420
advertising spending would fall below 50% next year for the first time since the research group started

155
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,780
tracking the market in 2008, primarily due to rapid growth in Amazon's marketing business.

156
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,160
The company is likely to appeal its antitrust cases all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.

157
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,580
This is the start of a long process, it said in Tuesday's blog post.

158
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:37,780
Yet Jason Kent, a big tech critic who leads the digital content Next trade group of online publishers,

159
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,600
said it was not a given that the Supreme Court would take up the case. He estimated that it could

160
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,800
take two or three years for any remedies to be enforced if the case proceeds through the courts,

161
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,520
adding, quote, the reality is Google is racking up legal losses, they have a difficult set of facts

162
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:58,140
along with spoliation from purging evidence, and they may try to settle or proactively make moves

163
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:09,740
to control the outcome, end quote. Finally today, a review. The Verge says that the Garmin

164
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:17,080
Phoenix 8, the $1,000 smartwatch, has excellent battery life and fitness tracking and an OLED display,

165
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:24,660
but it costs $350 more than the Phoenix 7 and lacks LTE, which apparently is key, quote.

166
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:30,040
The big additions to the Phoenix 8 are a speaker and microphone. They mean you can now interact

167
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,280
with the watch in more ways than fitness tracking and training. You can take calls from the wrist,

168
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,600
use an on-device voice assistant for setting timers and starting activities,

169
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,500
and connect to your phone's built-in assistant for more complex queries. If you can convince your

170
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,380
loved ones to download the new Garmin Messenger app, replying to messages on the wrist also has gotten

171
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:53,260
easier. Theoretically, these are all good updates. In practice, it means the Phoenix 8 doesn't play to

172
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,160
Garmin's strengths. The bulk of the smart updates zero in on the addition of the microphone and speaker,

173
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,920
namely voice assistants and calling from the wrist. But there's a big factor holding back the Phoenix

174
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:09,540
8's smart features, the lack of LTE. Yes, you can make and receive calls with the Phoenix 8 so long as

175
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,820
your phone is within Bluetooth range. Yes, you can talk to a voice assistant, but it's limited unless

176
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:21,540
your phone is nearby. Yes, you can reply to text, but you get my drift. If you get a cellular Apple Watch,

177
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,760
Galaxy Watch, or Pixel Watch, you can leave your phone at home. That's not really an option with

178
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,520
the Phoenix 8. The friction is particularly noticeable with the on-device voice assistant.

179
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,280
The assistant works pretty well, but it's mostly limited to commands that don't require an internet

180
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,960
connection. You can start activities, set timers, and tweak settings. It can tell you the weather,

181
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,160
provided it's loaded the day's weather from Wi-Fi or your phone via Bluetooth. But say you want to send

182
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,180
a text message. This nameless assistant can't do that. Instead, you'll have to scroll to a different menu

183
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,280
and launch your phone's assistant. It's good to have that option, but at that point, you're probably

184
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,400
just going to whip out your phone anyway. Part of the problem is that Garmin has always been staunchly

185
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,300
platform agnostic. I happen to think that's a good thing, but the price you pay is never having your

186
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,140
watch work quite as seamlessly with your phone. For example, it's great that you can dictate voice

187
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,140
memos now, but their usefulness is limited because there's no easy way to get them off your wrist and

188
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,300
onto another device. That's unlike the Pixel Watch 3 where I can just record something and boom,

189
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,940
it's magically on my Pixel 8 Pro. Everyone I've ever met with a Phoenix watch has been a triathlete,

190
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,300
ultramarathoner, or someone who casually qualifies for the Boston Marathon with a sub-three-hour

191
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,920
marathon time. These folks pick something like the Phoenix because they need a tracker with Mondo

192
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,380
battery life, stellar GPS accuracy, in-depth training programs, and maps for traversing trails.

193
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,580
Those are the features that people would leave Apple or Samsung for, and they don't get a major

194
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,340
upgrade with the Phoenix 8. To make matters worse, I almost choked when I saw the Phoenix 8's starting

195
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:57,100
price was a whole $350 more than the Phoenix 7. That's not a $50 to $100 hike where you grumble

196
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,260
and then begrudgingly admit that inflation is a bitch. For $999, you could buy a laptop. Hell,

197
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:10,360
the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is $800 while the Galaxy Watch Ultra is $650. Those do come with LTE,

198
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,040
and if you're determined to get a Garmin, there are literally dozens of cheaper options. Might I

199
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:22,040
suggest the $450 Forerunner, 265, or a discounted Phoenix 7 Pro or Epix Pro? It's frustrating because

200
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,960
Garmin is right to shore up its smart features. There's not much to improve on the fitness front,

201
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,200
so making its watches more useful outside of training makes a lot of sense. It's also crystal

202
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,240
clear that Garmin has some catching up to do, and progress isn't going to happen overnight.

203
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,160
The Phoenix 8 might be on the right track, but it doesn't quite nail the price or execution.

204
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,960
End quote.

205
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:57,420
Okay, everybody. Rad 80s, 90s history is currently number 34 on the history chart. Please, if you

206
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:03,640
haven't done so, subscribe to the show. Especially if you use Apple Podcasts, please follow the show

207
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:10,300
on Apple Podcasts. And also, write a review. Give it five stars and write a quick sentence or two

208
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,040
review. Even if you've already subscribed, go back and do that. It'll really help. We can do this,

209
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:20,080
people. We can get to number one. The history category is not as competitive as some others,

210
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,940
so we can make my dream come true of having a number one podcast. Link in the show notes to the

211
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,580
Apple Podcasts link itself. Again, please follow, rate, and review. Thanks in advance.
