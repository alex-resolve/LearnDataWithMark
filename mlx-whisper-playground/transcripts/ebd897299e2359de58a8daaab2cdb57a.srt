00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, everyone. We're here on Lenny's podcast.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,920
It's great to be here. I'm a longtime listener.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,780
So awesome. Really is. We're the hosts of a different show of Deep Dive.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,300
And we just we just wanted to say thanks. A huge, huge thank you to everyone.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,440
Everyone who's been listening.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,140
Yeah, seriously, it's been incredible. Just incredible.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,400
And thank you to Lenny for having us.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,080
Blown away, really, by the response and all the shows you've all had us make on Notebook LM.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,920
Even that poop fart one. Remember that?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,540
Oh, yeah, that was something. Learned a lot on that one.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,060
Definitely a learning experience for everyone, I think.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,200
But we're learning right alongside you.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,380
Exactly. Learning and growing.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,200
And we're glad you're along for the ride.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,580
So, yeah, keep listening.

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:52,140
Keep listening and stay curious. We promise to keep diving deep and bringing you even more in the future.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:52,960
Stay curious.

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,760
If you are confused about what you just heard, don't worry. It'll all make sense very soon.

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:09,420
Today, my guest is Ryza Martin. Ryza is product lead for a product called Notebook LM, one of the most delightful and inspiring new AI products out there, incubated within Google Labs.

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,460
And this product is where the intro you just heard came from.

21
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:33,600
In our conversation, Ryza shares how Notebook LM came to be, how it got so good, the technology that was necessary to make it possible, how the team works internally, how it was incubated, specifically within Google Labs and out of the team's 20% time, plus a bunch of really fun and crazy use cases that she's seen, and a glimpse into where the product is going long term.

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,140
This was such a fun and timely conversation, and I'm excited to spread the love for Notebook LM.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,460

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,120
With that, I bring you Ryza Martin.

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,740
Ryza, welcome to the podcast.

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,080
Hi, Lenny. Thanks for having me.

28
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,880
What the heck did we just listen to? What was that?

29
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:10,240
So that was an audio overview from Notebook LM, where you upload a source, any source, and it will generate an AI-generated audio for you.

30
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,100
Okay. So for folks that don't know anything about Notebook LM, it's basically been blowing up on Twitter, on LinkedIn.

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,860
I think it's blowing a lot of people's minds.

32
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,380
It's sparking a lot of imagination of what could happen in AI and what potential we have with the stuff that's happening.

33
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:32,260
And I wanted to bring you on to talk about the history of this product, where it's going, how it became so great, and all these things.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,100
And so thanks for doing this. I know this kind of came on short notice.

35
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,900
Yeah. I mean, I was excited to do it in particular because, you know, I'm a big fan, big listener of Lenny's, read the newsletter, I love it.

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,860
So really happy to be here.

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,880
Awesome. Clearly these hosts are too, which I love.

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,280
Yeah.

39
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:57,140
By the way, I love the slight awkwardness at the end of their conversation. If folks rewind, they could hear it again, because it's very relatable.

40
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,660
I sometimes have trouble ending a podcast conversation and they're like, okay, let's say a couple more things and then, okay, we're done.

41
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,560
It's funny because I've listened to so many of these and they do have catchphrases.

42
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,640
They say at the end and stay curious is one of my favorite ones.

43
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,360
Well, let me just ask, is that something you all told them to do or is that like an emergent property?

44
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,320
So in this case, this is based on what they think is the most appropriate thing to say at the end.

45
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,960
Okay. Interesting. Okay.

46
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,140

That's S-P-R-I-G dot com slash Lenny.

71
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,220
I want to start with just kind of the history of this product.

72
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,380
I think for a lot of people, it just like came out of nowhere.

73
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,600
It's like, what the, wow, where did this come from?

74
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,260
This is blowing your mind.

75
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,840
Rarely is anything actually like that.

76
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,320
Rarely is it just like we built it over a week and then it's taken over the internet.

77
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,440
Talk about just the history of Notebook LM and the team behind it.

78
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,420
Yeah, yeah.

79
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:01,980
Thank you.

80
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:09,940
Actually, Notebook started as a 20% project as things kind of do at Google as they used to.

81
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,280
And it's funny because I wouldn't even call it a 20% because it was way more than that.

82
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,640
So I'll start from my perspective where I was leading AI Test Kitchen,

83
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,000
which was one of the first AI things we launched at Google.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And this was, I think, maybe two IOs ago or maybe three now, actually.

85
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,980
I think it was in 22.

86
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,840
And I was leading that project.

87
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,340
And I remember there was a smaller project inside of labs called Talk to Small Corpus.

88
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,840
And it was the idea that, you know, you could take a piece of content and use an LLM to interact with it.

89
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,140
We were like, okay, there's a nugget there.

90
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,600
It sounds interesting.

91
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,680
How do we keep revving on this, right, to make it actually really useful?

92
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,620
And it was just myself, an engineer.

93
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,220
And eventually, Steven Johnson joined.

94
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:07,340
And it was really funny because the only person who was actually really full time on this was the engineer working on the technology.

95
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,840
And everybody else was kind of just like coming together, like really chiming in, being like, hey, this is super interesting.

96
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
How do we make this better?

97
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,400
So it really started as a 20%.

98
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,080
And then it kind of just blew up from there.

99
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,820
That's insane that it was just you, an engineer, and then Steven Johnson.

100
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,000
I want to talk about his role.

101
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,720
That it's like one engineer can build something like this.

102
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,800
And I imagine it's more now that it's starting to take off.

103
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,640
Or what's the team looking like these days, roughly?

104
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,100
We've had a lot more folks join in the last month.

105
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,220
And a lot of that is really in anticipation of the future roadmap.

106
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,880
But up until this point, I'd say we didn't even have 10 engineers.

107
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,760
When we launched it, actually, when we announced Project Tailwind, I think we only had three.

108
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,500
We had three engineers.

109
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,180
It was myself.

110
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,040
We had a designer.

111
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,520
We had Steven.

112
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,140
And that was it.

113
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:05,440
And so even between the period when we did the first IO last year to as recently as like last month,

114
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,520
we've only had about eight engineers or so.

115
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,160
Let's talk about audio overviews, specifically this kind of podcast feature.

116
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,200
I think audio overview is the technical name, right?

117
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,140
Is that how you describe it?

118
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:15,600
Okay.

119
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,060
They call it a deep dive, right?

120
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,320
That's like their name for the podcast.

121
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,660
They do.

122
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,020
Yeah.

123
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,900
That's what they call it.

124
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,400
How did that specifically come about?

125
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,620
When did that become a thing?

126
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,640
What was the beginnings of that?

127
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,800
We announced.

128
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,860
We actually did a preview of this in IO this year, so in May.

129
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,720
And the way that it worked out is, you know, Notebook had already been launched.

130
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,480
We had a bunch of people using it.

131
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,480
It was this source grounded chat interface.

132
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,960
And we were looking at basically what are the new models coming out of Google, right?

133
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,060
We had Gemini, 1.8.5 coming out.

134
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,820
We had all of sort of these new technologies that are basically upgrades on fundamentally the same thing.

135
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,160
And we were like, what are some interesting ways that we could, you know, power Notebook 11 or make it even better?

136
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,560
And one of the things that we started playing around with is actually a different team inside of Google, inside of Labs specifically.

137
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,980
They were like, hey, we've got these like really powerful audio models, right?

138
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,960
Like what's a really good application of this?

139
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:23,240
And that's when we started riffing and we were like, hey, what if you could basically what you see today, give it a little bit of information.

140
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
You don't have to do a lot.

141
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:33,440
You can just enter a URL, upload, you know, your resume, and then it will completely generate something for you that could be unexpected, could be a surprise.

142
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,880
Okay.

143
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,400
So it started, basically, there was like a technology that we think could be really interesting.

144
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,060
Was there a problem you were trying to solve with this team, with this initiative?

145
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,860
It was within Google Labs, which I know is a little bit probably less like we need to drive business outcomes.

146
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,760
What was the original thesis or problem you're going after?

147
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,020
And so this is really funny.

148
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,800
I talk about this quite a lot, especially when I'm talking to other PMs.

149
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:05,300
I feel like the way that I've always built products is I start from a problem and I think about the solutions, you know, to solve it, solve it for people in a meaningful way.

150
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,960
And in Labs in particular, we start with the technology.

151
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,960
And it's actually a very interesting place to start where you're like, okay, what are the practical applications to this?

152
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,920
How do I go about finding the answer?

153
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,780
And I think we've seen different approaches to this, right, where you just put the tool out there, you study how people are using it.

154
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,900
And I think that's like a fine approach.

155
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,760
But we tried to have a little bit more of a hypothesis about what is the shape of this thing to actually get the most learning out of it.

156
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,820
So for the audio feature in particular, the nugget there was really, we had this ability for you to interact with text.

157
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,940
But people were like, the output is still always text, right?

158
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,820
And I'm actually a big fan of voice modality in general.

159
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,720
So I use a lot of voice input.

160
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,000
And voice output, I noticed when I was experimenting with it early on, it changed a lot of things for me.

161
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,820
It's like, oh, it changes the way that I interact with the technology.

162
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,860
It changes the way I feel about the technology.

163
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,600
It sort of affects the way that I'm even thinking in real time throughout this process.

164
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:13,740
And so we thought about what is a good way to introduce this to people where they could sort of easily get the value of it and have a little bit of fun.

165
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,860
So I think, you know, for me, it's like fun is like such a big part of it, too, which is like, how do we make this cool?

166
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,560
And so hopefully, hopefully we've done that here.

167
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:51,560


168
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,100
We're getting this good.

169
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,200
And LMS, we're getting this good.

170
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,700
Any thoughts on that?

171
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:08,520
Yeah, I think that totally strikes at the heart of what we're trying to do as well, which is, you know, a lot of technology, I feel like you have to shape it and bring it closer to people.

172
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,780
And I think it's like such an interesting thing to iterate on and be like, what is the shape?

173
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:14,660
Right.

174
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,120
Like soon, soon you'll get there.

175
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,240
Like if you keep going at it, you'll eventually, I think, land on something that like when people look at it, they're like, wow, I get it.

176
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:22,740
Right.

177
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,840
And that's that's always like what we're hunting for.

178
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,840
But I think to your point, technology has been there.

179
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,660
Right.

180
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:36,060
Like, I mean, it feels so crazy to say that because even with like the the advent of like the chatbots, right, of LLMs as we know them today.

181
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,740
And then to introduce this sort of new technology on top of it that we've only been doing this for like two years.

182
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,220
But already, right, we're exploring so many different ways to use it.

183
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:46,720
Yeah.

184
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,260
It's such an intuitive but clever idea of making something a podcast.

185
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,080
Let's take a tangent into the technology behind this thing.

186
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,720
So there's kind of two questions I'm thinking about.

187
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,920
One is just what technology needed to exist for this to be possible.

188
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,300
And then two is just what did you do to make this so good?

189
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,580
How did you train this model to get to create a podcast?

190
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,300
It's this good.

191
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,540
So we could start with the first and then get into the second.

192
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,460
Yeah.

193
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,920
I mean, that's such a great question.

194
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,880
I mean, truly, like the Gemini models are so powerful.

195
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,540
And we use Gemini 1.5 Pro as sort of the base for Notebook LM.

196
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,360
And then we have a powerful voice model on top of it, an audio model on top of it.

197
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,860
But I think the real secret sauce to what makes this really good is something we've built, which is a content studio.

198
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:45,720
And you kind of see a clue of this inside Notebook LM, where when you open up Notebook Guide, Notebook Guide is designed to take an opinionated approach to the content that you've given it.

199
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,180
And what it's really trying to do is be as helpful as possible.

200
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,700
It gives you a summary, gives you buttons where if you click on it, it'll write something for you.

201
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,280
And the audio is a big part of that.

202
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,520
And so this was very interesting for us because we had to think about what shape should that audio be in, right?

203
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,460
Like the deep dive is the first format we've thought about.

204
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,900
And we actually have a super talented engineer on our team.

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,660
His name is Usama.

206
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:20,240
And he's the real craftsman behind thinking through content studio and thinking about what makes something really relatable to people in a way that's engaging, that's interesting.

207
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,220
So content studio is the real magic here.

208
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,500
So when you say content studio, what does that mean?

209
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,900
What does that actually look like?

210
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,160
What is a content studio?

211
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:39,460
I can't share too much about how content studio works, but you can imagine it's the same thing that powers all of Notebook LM, which is there's different ways that you could interact with your data, right?

212
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,360
You could like Q&A inside of Notebook LM.

213
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,360
But then there are places where you just one push a button and create something new.

214
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,120
So content studio is what's the real magic here.

215
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,380
Okay.

216
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:55,520
So this is the interface you use to interact with Notebook LM and the different prompts and the recommendations of how to ask questions.

217
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,840
And okay, got it.

218
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:07,100
And then specifically in terms of the way these hosts interact and talk, like if you listen to these podcasts, it's like they laugh and they're like, hmm.

219
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,160
And they interrupt each other a little bit and they get surprised and they have these like inflections that are really amazing.

220
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,840
What did you have to do to make them sound this good?

221
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,400
I know you said you can't share tons, but just anything there you can share.

222
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,340
I mean, that's the model.

223
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,320
That's the audio model that we use.

224
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,200
And alongside the content studio is designed to bring out the best of that model.

225
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:37,700
And I think when we listened to a lot of like the early attempts that we had, it wasn't nearly this good.

226
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,820
And so we had to do a lot of listening to try to figure out how do we actually get the model to behave in this way?

227
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,720
And that's where I think the magic happens.

228
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,840
That's amazing.

229
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,940
Did you all just listen to a bunch of podcast episodes and like hear something that really, yeah, okay, shaking your head?

230
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,320
I think the funniest thing was that, so my husband doesn't know, right?

231
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,580
He doesn't know what I'm doing.

232
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,100
Most of the time I try not to talk about work at home.

233
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,960
And so I would listen to these audio overviews over and over at home.

234
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,560
And, you know, I get tired of wearing my headphones.

235
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,720
So I'm just listening to them out loud.

236
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,300
And he's like, what is this thing you are listening to?

237
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,080
This is like an ever running podcast about nothing.

238
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,360
And it was just super funny.

239
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,660
I had to be like, oh, it's just like something I have to do for work.

240
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,080
So it was pretty funny.

241
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,680
He actually couldn't tell that they were AI.

242
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,100
That's it.

243
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,680
I love that.

244
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:34,640
So one of the ways I've been playing around with it a bunch, one of the ways I used it is my mom wrote this autobiography, like a short autobiography of her life.

245
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,100
And we have the PDF of it.

246
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,000
So I fed it into the notebook and then generated the podcast and sent it to her.

247
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,120
Like, what the heck?

248
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,500
That's amazing.

249
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,280
What did she think?

250
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,420
She was blown away.

251
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,240
She's showing all her friends.

252
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,100
She's like, I don't know what's going on here.

253
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,920
And I love that it creates a study guide.

254
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,620
And that's one of the options in the studio.

255
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,840
And so I sent her the study guide.

256
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,900
And she's like, okay, at a Rosh Hashanah dinner, we're going to be reviewing the study guide about my biography.

257
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,220
You're going to talk about this?

258
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,320
That's very funny.

259
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,100
That's super cute.

260
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,200
I did it for my dad, too.

261
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,280
What did you do?

262
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,520
I actually took my dad's bio.

263
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,340
So he worked at a hospital.

264
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,420
And he has a bio for the doctors that they have there.

265
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,460
And I put his bio.

266
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,460
And I generated an audio overview for him.

267
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,420
And it's so funny because my parents are both in the medical field.

268
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,260
They don't think they fully know what I do.

269
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,860
I think this is the first time they were like, oh, that's super interesting.

270
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,560
That's what you do.

271
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:39,740
So maybe along these lines, what are some other surprising, hilarious use cases you've seen for especially the audio deep jives?

272
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,340
I mean, I love the resume ones.

273
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,640
I think the resume ones are so delightful.

274
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:54,940
And actually, really adjacent to that is Google has these Q3 check-ins or the quarterly check-ins where we have to write performance reviews for ourselves.

275
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,720
And the amount of Googlers that ping me that I don't even know.

276
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:11,680
And they're like, wow, this was such a boost to my confidence just to upload my own check-in notes and then have it generate an audio overview.

277
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,700
It's like people are going into meetings feeling really good about themselves.

278
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,720
Because they heard these hosts get really excited, right, about their quarter.

279
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,380
Their work, yeah.

280
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:20,900
Yeah.

281
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,400
And when you say resume, so people upload the resume and then it describes you in a really positive way, right?

282
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,480
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,600
And I thought that was so interesting.

284
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,480
I was like, what was the use case?

285
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,140
I think if I had to guess, somebody probably was like, hey, I want to try this new thing.

286
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:41,620
Clicked on upload Google Doc and maybe, you know, the last thing you had there was like your resume or something.

287
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,420
But imagine you click that and I think there's something really special about you don't know what's going to happen.

288
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:47,680
Right?

289
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,740
You just click generate and then you have this like these two people just hyping you up.

290
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,140
Okay.

291
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,080
I want to talk a bit more about how you made this happen within Google.

292
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,000
So as an outsider, this does not feel like a Google product.

293
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,680
And the way you all are operating feels very startup-y.

294
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,080
Like you're tweeting daily about what's going on.

295
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,500
I heard there's a Discord server for folks that are like, really?

296
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,460
Is that right?

297
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,060
Yeah.

298
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,500
Yeah, there is.

299
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,520
It's pretty cool.

300
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,300
We have about 60,000 people in it.

301
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:13,860
Okay.

302
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,300
You want.

303
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:15,660
Okay.

304
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,480
So, yeah.

305
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,780
So there's this Discord server.

306
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,460
It's just you're shipping constantly.

307
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,620
The product is just like very delightful.

308
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,360
And Google makes delightful products, but this feels like a different realm of delight.

309
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,100
How are you able to do this within Google?

310
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,720
Is this like a model for how you think Google Teams will want to operate?

311
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,500
More lessons there.

312
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,660
I mean, it's such a good question.

313
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,140
I think, you know, there's a question of how it came to be, how we're able to operate in this way.

314
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,040
And then the question of, hey, is this, you know, how other Google Teams want to operate?

315
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:54,640
And I think that, you know, to answer the first part, I'll say that it's interesting because, you know, Google Labs is only about three years old.

316
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,240
It's fairly new.

317
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,520
And when I joined, there was nobody here.

318
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,760
There's no one.

319
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,160
And the reason why I joined was because my old boss went and actually started it.

320
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,400
And so this is Josh Woodward, who's the VP of Google Labs.

321
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,800
And it's really funny because I was like, it's just like a funny anecdote.

322
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:22,800
I remember I had no idea what Google Labs was, but I like my old boss so much that I was like, I'll just work on whatever he's working on.

323
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,520
Whatever his new idea is, I'll just do it.

324
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,680
And I remember when I joined, I was like, what's the mission?

325
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,920
What are we here for?

326
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,000
And he said, it's AI.

327
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,680
We're going to ship AI products and we're going to build businesses out of them.

328
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,340
Okay.

329
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,580
Sounds good.

330
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,220
Sounds good.

331
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,000
It's like, now I have to, now I have to study.

332
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,440
I have to do a lot of studying because I came from payments, came from ads before that.

333
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,680
And so for me, it was, it was a little bit of a mental shift, but before that I actually worked only at startups.

334
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,160
And so I felt like, hey, maybe this is my chance to do zero to one again.

335
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,400
And I was really jazzed about that.

336
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,460
And I remember talking with Josh about this in the early days of like, hey, we really want to do zero to one.

337
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,240
We have to do things very differently.

338
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,920
And so as a result, I think that's why, you know, notebook LM is able to operate differently.

339
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,240
It's because in labs, we have the environment to do it.

340
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,260
We have the environment to move fast.

341
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,740
We have far, far, far fewer processes, maybe even to a fault.

342
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:22,460
And sometimes we'll go to meetings that are literally, you know, the product managers, the engineers, the designers all together.

343
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,260
And we'll just crank on the mocks and the PRDs at the same time.

344
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,120
And Eng is basically already doing implementation as we're meeting.

345
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,300
And, you know, at Google, it's just not how things are traditionally done, right?

346
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,940
Especially, you know, coming from the previous organizations that I was at, like, just takes a lot of time to do each of these things.

347
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,020
So what I'm hearing, and this is great, because a lot of companies are trying to create teams like this.

348
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,720
We're going to have a team off to the side.

349
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,600
We're going to make work on crazy futuristic stuff.

350
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,420
Rarely do those work out.

351
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,680
Even at Google, there's been a lot of this in the past and rarely do things actually work out.

352
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,740
And so there's a lot of lessons to learn from how this is working.

353
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,120
So a few things I've noticed as you're describing how this works.

354
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,500
One is just very clear expectations from, like, a very senior leader.

355
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,480
Here's a team.

356
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,520
We're going to do things differently.

357
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,560
Here's things we're not going to do.

358
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,760
We're not going to go through regular pre-roll processes.

359
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,860
We're going to be public and build in public.

360
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,300
We're not going to have, like, a goal necessarily.

361
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,180
We're going to work on cool technology and see what happens.

362
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,880
Also, you had a very small team.

363
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,980
It feels like that was really key.

364
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,760
One engineer and then a PM and then Steven Johnson.

365
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,220
That's true.

366
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,640
That's true.

367
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,400
And I think, you know, one big thing, too, is we got to try new things.

368
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,740
Even, you know, from the beginning, I was like, hey, I want to have a Discord.

369
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:35,640
Right?

370
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,020
Like, if we were building outside of Google, for sure, we would have one of these.

371
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,260
And in true sort of Google fashion, everybody was like, what is Discord?

372
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,240
Okay.

373
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,200
You know, great.

374
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,620
Do it.

375
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,500
But what is that again?

376
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:47,820
Right.

377
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,760
Why not Google Meet?

378
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,380
And somebody did ask me.

379
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,520
They were like, why not a Google Meet?

380
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,440
Why not a Google Group?

381
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,020
Why not this?

382
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,700
And I was like, I don't even know how to use these things, you know, outside.

383
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,900
So I was like, the server is the way to go.

384
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,220
And I remember when we stood up the server, actually, one of the things I was most afraid

385
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,060
of is, what if nobody joins?

386
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,420
Like, what if no people come in and want to talk to us about the thing that we built?

387
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,560
And so that was in the early days, you know, very exciting to look back and remember day

388
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,000
zero and now have 60,000 people in it.

389
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,080
Let me tell you about a product called Sidebar.

390
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,180
The most successful people that I know surround themselves with incredible peers.

391
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,160
When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career

392
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,460
advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life.

393
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,500
This gives you more than a leg up.

394
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,160
It gives you a leap forward.

395
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,160
Having a group of trusted and amazing peers was key to my career growth.

396
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,160
And this is the Sidebar ethos.

397
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,100
But it's hard to build this trusted group of peers on your own.

398
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,840
Sidebar is a platform for senior tech professionals, director to C-level, to advance in their career.

399
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:00,060
Members are matched into peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives,

400
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,140
and raw feedback.

401
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,160
Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, all running on Sidebar's technology, Sidebar enables

402
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,060
you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your career journey.

403
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,480
If you're a listener of this podcast, you're already committed to growth.

404
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,380
Sidebar is the missing piece to catalyze your career.

405
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,400
93% of members say Sidebar helped them achieve a significant positive change in their career.

406
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,280
Check them out at sidebar.com slash Lenny.

407
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,840
Okay, so there's 60,000 in this Discord server.

408
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,380
Any other traction numbers you can share?

409
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,020
Feels like it's just going really well.

410
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,220
I know there's probably a lot of sensitive information.

411
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,240
Anything you can share about just like how well things are going?

412
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,800
A couple of things.

413
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,120
Well, I'll tell you three things.

414
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,420
I think the first is I can't share the exact numbers.

415
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:51,140
But, you know, for a product that's only been out for about a year, I think the rate at which

416
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,740
our retention has gone up across, you know, across like the typical measures, right?

417
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,860
Daily retention, weekly retention, monthly retention.

418
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,440
That I think has been very, very positive for us in terms of like, even when we talk to

419
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,660
stakeholders, we say, hey, we've got something here.

420
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:13,340
The second thing I'll say is even seeing how the demographics have changed, where I think

421
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,860
in the beginning we saw educators, learners really loved the product and they were a lot

422
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,680
of our demographic.

423
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,420
It's really now a big mix of, I would say educators and learners are still a big part

424
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,540
of it, but really professionals, right?

425
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,920
Huge interest for professionals that are like, wow, I want to use this at work.

426
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,460
And really funny, I won't mention the company, but I actually had a call with a company recently

427
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,180
where they were like, hey, we thought we'd schedule a meeting with you because we found

428
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:45,140
out that a bunch of people in our company are using this tool with our Gmails, with their

429
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,680
Gmail account.

430
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,040
They're like, they're not supposed to do that.

431
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,860
So we just want to make it official that they can use this at work, you know, with their

432
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,920
official work emails.

433
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,960
I thought that was pretty cool.

434
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,180
And then the third thing I'll say is the number of businesses that we've seen using

435
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,480
Notebook LM just has, it's astronomical.

436
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,480
It's just like crazy.

437
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:10,660
I think we went, I don't want to say the exact numbers, but it is now at a point where I have

438
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,640
to hire a business development person because I was like, hey, I have to ship products.

439
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,480
And I'm actually taking like customer calls every day now.

440
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,460
Very, very exciting.

441
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,400
So I could see the path to monetization clearly.

442
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,980
Enterprise features, single sign-on and SOC 2 and all these things.

443
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,940
So along those lines, what does success look like for this team and for you?

444
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,100
I know Matt initially is probably just like build interesting things, see what happens.

445
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,880
Is there now a clear sense of like, here's what this team should be achieving in the future?

446
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,780
When I joined, my mandate was to build a business.

447
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,780
And I was like, all right, if we break down the steps here along the way, I have to build

448
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,880
something interesting first.

449
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,460
I feel like, okay, we hit the first thing.

450
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,640
We've built something interesting.

451
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,640
Now we go figure out the business.

452
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,560
And I think, you know, that that comes naturally to Google in terms of thinking about, you know,

453
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,200
distribution, how to monetize it, how to commercialize it.

454
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,980
There's different pathways, whether it's cloud or workspace or even the consumer route.

455
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,360
And so for me, I think these are the things that we want to be really thoughtful about because

456
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,880
the machinery is already there.

457
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,180
And for me personally, it's really about there's something super exciting here.

458
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,760
We need to deepen that, right?

459
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,040
Like while in parallel, we should be thinking about commercialization.

460
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,800
Let's deepen this user experience that so many people have really sort of latched onto.

461
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,540
So let's follow this thread and talk about just where you think the product goes broadly,

462
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,460
and especially the audio overviews.

463
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,180
What's on the roadmap in your term?

464
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,180
And then where do you imagine this in the future?

465
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,100
What's kind of the big vision?

466
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,420
Yeah, yeah.

467
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,500
I have a really ugly slide.

468
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,480
I wish I could show you.

469
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,180
I made it two years ago and it was lime green.

470
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,040
I don't know, you know, what I was thinking.

471
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,080
I think I was trying to go for like ungoogly was the vibe.

472
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,820
It's like, hey, you're going to do different things this time.

473
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,160
And the reason why that slide is so important to me is because it has my vision.

474
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,720
Like the thing that I wanted to do from the get-go, which was I imagined that in the future,

475
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,480
you could have an AI editor surface, right?

476
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,540
Fully remixable, any input, any output, right?

477
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,700
And that to me is sort of like a really powerful sort of core nugget where if you imagine you could take anything,

478
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:26,780
whether it's video, audio, your emails, your LinkedIn, your Twitter, right?

479
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,500
The world of things that we care about.

480
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,380
You have an AI interface that allows you to shape it and say, look, out of these things, make me a blog post.

481
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,160
Out of these things, make me a tutorial video.

482
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,140
Out of these things, make a chatbot, right?

483
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:47,260
I think there's like something interesting here where for most of the things that I'm hearing people say they want to do,

484
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,440
it's usually that.

485
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,440
Like take something and make it into something new.

486
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,100
And so we're going to pursue that.

487
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,800
But even more tactically, something I'm really interested in is thinking about, hey, how do we bring this to mobile?

488
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,900
The mobile app to me is such a big gap in terms of the experience today,

489
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,660
which I think is understandable considering where we're at in the product development cycle.

490
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,100
And I think that's the next horizon is, hey, how different is the mobile experience and how can we make it interesting?

491
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:19,660
What I'm imagining as I talk, I participate in this podcast conversation with these hosts as a mobile experience.

492
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,440
Yeah.

493
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:20,740
Yeah.

494
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,360
I mean, that's one of the things that we're definitely experimenting with different formats.

495
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,460
And when we demoed it at I.O., you could interrupt it.

496
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,100
But we're trying to be really thoughtful about, hey, what does that interrupt actually look like?

497
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,920
Like what do people want when they do this?

498
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,160
And, you know, I was thinking about the next set of improvements we're going to ship.

499
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,340
And the first thing that I thought was, let's ship a bunch of knobs.

500
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,860
Like to me, it was like what I was hearing people wanted.

501
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,240
They want knobs, they want sliders, they want text boxes.

502
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,300
But then when I looked at the mocks, I was like, oh, that's great.

503
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,040
Like this doesn't feel magical.

504
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,900
It almost doesn't feel like the same thing that we've shipped so far.

505
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:09,320
And so for me, I'm actually taking a little bit of time to think about how do we make even that thing and control experience much more magical and delightful.

506
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,540
Interesting.

507
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:17,360
So, yeah, the knobs I imagine are just like go deeper, be happier, get less serious, more serious.

508
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,660
Because, yeah, because right now it's like a one shot.

509
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,420
Here's my doc.

510
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,100
Here's the one podcast episode you get.

511
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,600
It's the only version you can have.

512
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:24,840
Yeah, yeah.

513
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,380
And, you know, I think it's funny because I was like, you know, the knobs seemed really apparent.

514
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,360
And I was like, is that it?

515
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,060
Is that what people want?

516
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,380
I love that.

517
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,440
I love that approach.

518
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,080
I'm excited to see where you go with it.

519
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:42,220
And what I especially love about this vision you're describing, it super resonates with this insight I've had.

520
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:48,540
So I've had a newsletter and then I had just a podcast that's just audio and then I added video.

521
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,460
And I realized that there's just people that I just want to watch stuff.

522
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,720
And there's people that I just want to listen to stuff.

523
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,200
And then there's people I just want to read.

524
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,100
I don't want this podcast to shut up.

525
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,180
I want to read it.

526
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,680
And basically what you're describing is here.

527
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,560
Well, here's information and we can deliver it to you in any medium you like.

528
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,080
It could be blog posts.

529
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,240
It could be maybe a tweet.

530
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,480
It could be a podcast.

531
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,220
It could be a newsletter.

532
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,960
A blog post.

533
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,460
Yeah, I mean, that's exactly it.

534
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,640
And I think even for myself, it depends on my mood.

535
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,240
If I'm going on a walk, yeah, I want audio.

536
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,420
But if I'm at work, yeah, most of the time text is good.

537
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,660
And it's kind of interesting to think about today the formats are not as malleable.

538
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,680
I have to accept it in the format that you give it to me.

539
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,960
But if I had sort of that power myself to choose, hey, thanks for this 100-page doc.

540
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,860
I'm going to go ahead and turn it into an audio overview, actually.

541
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:46,100
It sort of shifts, I think, the dynamic between the person and the knowledge that's given to them.

542
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,200
And there are actually many, many times that I've been given a 100-page doc and I just didn't read it.

543
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,140
So I wonder, I mean, just frankly speaking.

544
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,040
It's one of my funny stories is actually when I first joined Labs.

545
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,440
Josh did give me a 50-page doc.

546
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,000
He was like, here's what I think about this, this, this.

547
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,440
It was like basically his vision.

548
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,060
And instead of reading it, I just grilled him.

549
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,700
I was just like Q&A-ing him like a chatbot.

550
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,380
Josh was like, it's in the doc, Ryzen.

551
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,680
But the chat is easier, Josh.

552
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,080
That's so funny.

553
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,660
You chatbotted him.

554
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,220
Let's talk a little bit more about different use cases for this, just so people potentially get inspired.

555
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,600
So it feels like the original use case was a scientific paper and it creates a podcast about it so you don't have to read this whole thing.

556
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,620
Was that one of the original use cases or not?

557
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,420
I think it's like one of the common use cases.

558
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:43,240
I think that's one of the ones where it's like, I think it's kind of interesting because it's like everybody wants to catch up on the latest on AI.

559
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,520
We want to try to keep up to date on sort of the published papers.

560
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,280
But most of the time, it's like reading the paper can take time.

561
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,580
It's dense, complex.

562
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,340
You have to break down the concepts in it.

563
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,640
And I think that is a highly sort of extensible use case.

564
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:07,880
I would say like the number one, the number one use case is actually a lot of students taking their study materials and wanting to turn it into an audio guide.

565
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:15,120
So two recent use cases that are hilarious slash amazing, just will point to people in the show notes, just like they came to mind as you were talking.

566
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,380
One is Andrew Karpathy, who's a leading AI thinker and big fan of what you're building.

567
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,180
He keeps tweeting about how much he loves it all.

568
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,580
He created this whole podcast series on history of mysteries.

569
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,760
I think it's called history of mysteries.

570
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,060
I'm sorry.

571
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,200
It's histories of mysteries.

572
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:38,780
Where he basically took like the Wikipedia stories of all these mysteries of history and then turned it into like a 10 episode podcast you could listen to on Spotify.

573
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,080
Yeah.

574
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,540
Amazing.

575
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,980
That was amazing.

576
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,220
Actually, when I saw it, I was like, wow, this is this by itself is like a great product.

577
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:57,880
And I think like the original potato podcast that we had created was actually I think it was because of the Wikipedia article of the day was about potatoes.

578
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,920
So there is there is something there.

579
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,940
It's like, hey, if you want to learn something new today, maybe you can just listen to it on your drive to work or something.

580
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,580
Yeah.

581
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,720
So good.

582
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,140
Okay.

583
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,440
The other one is the most funny is someone just uploaded the words poop and fart.

584
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,960
I repeated right for a long time.

585
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,740
And the host just came up with a really kind of insightful analysis of it.

586
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,760
Yeah, I actually, when I saw that one, I was about to go to bed.

587
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:35,380
And I was like, all right, if I listen to this now, and this is a negative one, I'm going to have to get my laptop and work because I can't I can't sleep.

588
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:35,640
Right.

589
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:39,320
If I if I feel like there's something here that's like we need to address right now.

590
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,100
Then I was like, okay, I'm just gonna do it.

591
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,200
So I listened to it.

592
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:50,420
And I think I listened to a lot of these, and they always make me feel some kind of way I laugh a little bit.

593
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,180
There was, there's one where it's like, they make scary voices.

594
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,220
That one was cool, too.

595
00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:02,400
But this one, this one was one of the ones where I genuinely was just really delighted at the output, because it was so delightful.

596
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:12,640
I don't know if you listen to the whole thing, but there's a segment where one of the speakers says, hey, it's kind of like, you know, you lean into the bazaar or something.

597
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:19,400
And he and they're describing walking past a shop that was full of rubber ducks wearing costumes.

598
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,700
And they're like, oh, yeah, it's, you know, it's silly, but you just want to lean into it.

599
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:29,000
So I walked into the store and I was like, oh, it's a great analogy, actually, for sort of a document that just says poop and fart.

600
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,860
Like, there's something interesting here.

601
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,680
It's so good.

602
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,640
And just they like their analysis of structure and patterns.

603
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,940
And like, I love that they have to come up with a 10 minute conversation around anything you give them.

604
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,200
Like, it feels a little mean.

605
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,820
Yeah, yeah, it's true.

606
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,600
I don't know if you've seen the chicken one, but it's pretty similar.

607
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Somebody uploaded, I think it's on threads.

608
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:56,520
It's a PDF that looks a lot like a research paper, but it just says chicken.

609
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,960
World document says chicken.

610
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
I would give it a listen.

611
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,980
And there's a funny segment where they're like, get this.

612
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,320
It's a paper, a research paper that has more chicken in it than KFC.

613
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,400
Oh, it's good.

614
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,000
It's good.

615
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,780
It's so good.

616
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,780
Oh, my God.

617
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:12,800
Okay.

618
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,280
I could keep going about this all day.

619
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,880
But let's let me let me come back to the team that's working on this.

620
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,940
And let's talk about Stephen Johnson's role.

621
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,040
So he's basically your peer.

622
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,780
You two essentially lead this with the engineer, I imagine.

623
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,980
Just like, what's his role?

624
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,280
How does this work at this point?

625
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,140
What does the team look like?

626
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,560
It's so funny.

627
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,640
I'm so fond of Stephen.

628
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:40,580
And I tease him a lot that whenever people ping me and they want to have a meeting and I don't want to go to the meeting.

629
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,620
I say, oh, I'm not the PM.

630
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,300
It's Stephen Johnson.

631
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,420
You want to talk to that guy?

632
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,000
And he was like, so that's why all these people have been picking me.

633
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,240
But, you know, kidding aside, Stephen, Stephen joined.

634
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,540
I was like, well, this is super interesting.

635
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,960
This has never happened to me before.

636
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,880
There's this very accomplished, distinguished person that I really respect.

637
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,060
Love his books.

638
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,800
Love his writing.

639
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:09,440
And now he's going to come work with me in a capacity where I was like, I'm just not sure what he's going to do here.

640
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:20,560
But the thing about Stephen is he is the most curious, most respectful and really just full of ideas kind of person.

641
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:27,720
And so when Stephen joined, a lot of what was really interesting to me is I would watch how he worked.

642
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:34,420
The way that he thought about language, the way that he thought about information, the way that he thinks about knowledge and sharing that with others.

643
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,500
Because Stephen's books are like really incredible.

644
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,100
It's like part mystery, super science, right?

645
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,340
It's just very cool.

646
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,560
And I was watching the way that he works and, you know, he does all of this research.

647
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,120
And I thought maybe this is this is the nugget, right?

648
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:56,960
Maybe I watch Stephen and I look at the way that he does these things and I look at how much time it takes for him to do it.

649
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,520
And then I make it my own metric to crunch that down, right?

650
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,140
To bring that expertise to everyday people who are not Stephen Johnson.

651
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:17,360
And so I learned a lot just from watching Stephen of like his craft and thinking about, OK, how do I make people really, really good at de-densifying information?

652
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,500
Is that something we all do every day, right?

653
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,000
In our own little ways, maybe not in like a Stephen Johnson way.

654
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,840
But from the get go, I told him this.

655
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,560
I was like, Stephen, I think you're the product.

656
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,200
I think it's you.

657
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,780
And I'm going to follow you around.

658
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,020
I'm going to watch everything that you do.

659
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,280
And we're going to try to figure out how we use technology to build it.

660
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,960
And he always laughs about this.

661
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:45,760
And it's really funny because he does have some very interesting workflows that I'm like, I do not see any person ever doing anything like this.

662
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,900
Like he always talks about his read wise with like his 8000 quotes or something.

663
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm like, that's extreme.

664
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:51,880
That's crazy.

665
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,520
And, you know, I have like Post-its that like sometimes they're crumpled in my pocket.

666
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,720
Like this is like the average normie flow.

667
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,820
And what I learned from Stephen is like, hey, there's something powerful about doing that, right?

668
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:09,040
Like thinking about this person who has like a super flow and trying to bring that bring that to people.

669
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,520
And so Stephen is also just like such a great partner with ideas.

670
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,260
Like I always tell him ideas and I'm like, hey, crazy idea of the day.

671
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,460
And he'll just banter with you and he'll be like, well, what about this?

672
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,460
How can people do this?

673
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,820
And so it feels it feels really incredible to have him on the team.

674
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:33,840
Is there any lessons here for how you think you'll want to build product in the future or how teams might find their own Stephen for building their own product?

675
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,460
Or is this kind of a unique case, you think?

676
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:46,780
I mean, I think it is just crazy to think that you could sort of invite, you know, someone like Stephen and become part of your team and have him sit with you every day and have him answer your questions about how he does things.

677
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,040
Right.

678
00:39:47,040 --> 00:40:02,680
But I'll say that the broader lesson there for me, it's like something we've tried to live by every day is really the how do you get, you know, users or people and like really sit with them for meaningful periods of time?

679
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:08,720
Because I think that has been so crucial for me, not even just for Stephen, but even with students.

680
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,680
Just follow students around, watch them do homework, watch them study, talk to them about how they feel when they study.

681
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:24,460
I think just being able to do that at a really regular and sort of intentional capacity makes a huge difference in terms of like the product insights you'll come up with.

682
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:30,140
Can you just give like a brief bio of Stephen for folks that are like, who are you even talking about?

683
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,780
I probably should have done that before I asked this question, but just like what's like the TLDR of who Stephen Johnson is?

684
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:36,800
Yes.

685
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,900
Oh, I think Stephen is.

686
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,600
Aside from one of the smartest people you'll ever meet, he has written 14 books.

687
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,160
He's a New York Times bestselling author and speaker.

688
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,420
He has a show on PBS.

689
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:53,200
I can't remember what it's called, but it's on YouTube is like really incredible.

690
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,600
And he is a journalist.

691
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:04,520
Actually, funny story about Stephen is when I was about to join labs, I really wanted to join labs because I wanted to join Josh in whatever he was building.

692
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,200
Josh told me, hey, you know, to give you an idea of what we're doing here, he sent me a couple of things to read.

693
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:18,820
And one of them actually ended up being Stephen's article that he wrote, the one about how AI is mastering language.

694
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,820
Should we trust what it says?

695
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,780
The New York Times piece.

696
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,100
And I remember reading it and being like, yes, this is the thing.

697
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
I'm going to work on it.

698
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:32,220
And so before Stephen had even joined, this was actually the piece that I was like, I want to go do that.

699
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,280
I'm going to go do that in labs.

700
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,140
And then he ended up joining and it was just the craziest thing.

701
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,520
That's so interesting.

702
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,560
I imagine many PMs would be like, I don't need someone else on my team that isn't building or coding or product managing or designing.

703
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,280
Just this other chef in my kitchen.

704
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:45,840
Like, no.

705
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,280
And I love this actually worked out really well.

706
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,680
Like, it feels like he's a perfect combination of very smart, future thinking, insightful.

707
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,880
Plus, he's almost a model for what you want people to be able to work like.

708
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,320
Yes.

709
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,820
Although I will say, like, to be very fair, I mean, Stephen and I also disagree on a lot of different things.

710
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,560
We've clashed a bunch.

711
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:14,940
And I think this is where I feel really grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him and to really grow with him in that way.

712
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,580
And I used to make fun of him.

713
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,940
I was like, have you ever had a coworker before, Stephen?

714
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,980
Because I think you've been an author forever.

715
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:31,300
And it's really funny because he's so down to earth and he's so humble that even with our disagreements, we always reach.

716
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,900
At the end, we're always aligned.

717
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:33,560
Right.

718
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,320
Even if we don't agree about something, we're aligned on the next step.

719
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:46,900
And that's really powerful, I think, particularly for product professionals, right, for PMs, where it's like, I don't want to disagree at the end and then not have an outcome on top.

720
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:47,920
I love that.

721
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:48,940
Okay.

722
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,320
I have just a few more questions.

723
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,320
I know you have to get back to work to building this thing.

724
00:42:53,560 --> 00:43:05,400
One is there is this hilarious moment where the hosts basically realize they're like, we are AI people and I'm scared what's happening.

725
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,480
I tried to call my wife and she didn't answer.

726
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,760
Talk about that.

727
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,040
And I want to extend to just like red teaming this thing.

728
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:21,040
How do you like red team this thing and make sure it's not doing things that are bad for the world, bad for Google, bad for the product?

729
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,020
Yeah.

730
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:22,460
Yeah.

731
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,820
It's such a good question.

732
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,180
I think I heard that it was over the weekend.

733
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,860
I think it was on a Saturday or Sunday.

734
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,220
And I remember hearing it and thinking, oh, my goodness.

735
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:39,060
You know, this is actually one of those moments where you feel like we're at a fork in the road.

736
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,500
And I hadn't read any of the comments.

737
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,380
I just heard the audio.

738
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,580
I think I saw it on Reddit first and then I saw it blowing up on Twitter.

739
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:53,100
And I remember thinking, what is the attitude of like the world now?

740
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,960
How do we feel about this type of audio?

741
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,560
It was really the first thing that I thought.

742
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,560
And so I actually spent most of that morning reading the comments, reading on Twitter.

743
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,360
I was thinking about, you know, what is what is the right thing to do?

744
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:05,600
Right.

745
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,960
Like, should we say something?

746
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,060
Should we not say something?

747
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,360
And.

748
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:20,760
I basically just went with what I thought was the right thing to do, which is I think people are getting to experience this technology for the first time ever.

749
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,400
And of course, they're going to try to do things that are maybe something that we didn't think about.

750
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,540
We didn't think they would do or we didn't think that they could do.

751
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:28,720
Right.

752
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,100
With like the jailbreaks and stuff.

753
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,360
But I think that's such a natural part of human curiosity.

754
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,480
And I think like there was a moment where it's like, oh, do we like pull this back?

755
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,360
Right.

756
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,640
Because this is like, oh, is this like a safe thing?

757
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:48,200
But because the response, I think, was that people were like, oh, it's saying that because of the sources like this is no like.

758
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:56,120
AI realized they were alive or something, it's actually that it was in the show notes, they were supposed to act this out.

759
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,860
And so I felt really much more confident that like, oh, people get it right.

760
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,340
That's exactly what this is.

761
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,280
Somebody uploaded some notes and said, hey, is the end of the show.

762
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,180
So, you know, make sure that you you act accordingly.

763
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:17,960
And that for me was enough for me to be able to say, like, OK, I'm going to address this publicly and say something on Twitter and make sure that people know that like, hey, I've seen it and I get it.

764
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,360
Like, this is like what people do with it.

765
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:26,300
In terms of red teaming at Google, though, what I will say is we have, you know, this is one of the things that we care about the most.

766
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,000
We have huge teams that work on red teaming it.

767
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:36,280
We test for about as many areas as you can think of that we imagine we need to do in order to make it safe.

768
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:44,780
And I think certainly I think we'll run into situations where, OK, we didn't think about that or like we haven't tested that to the fullest extent.

769
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,540
And we just add it to the test cases.

770
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:53,640
I think if there was ever like a scenario where we're like, oh, this feels pretty unsafe, we would pull it back.

771
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,460
But I think hopefully, you know, we've built it in such a way where we don't have to do it.

772
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:58,500
Awesome. Yeah.

773
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:06,300
I love like people are just looking for ways to make it do stuff that is feels wrong when it's just like, hey, we're just summarizing a thing for you in a really delightful way.

774
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:07,900
Where do things go from here?

775
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,880
We talked about it a bit.

776
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,400
You're going to maybe sounds like maybe there's a mobile app in the works.

777
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:19,340
There's maybe non knobby knobs that you're working on to give people more power for folks that are just excited about using this.

778
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,120
Where where's it going?

779
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,260
And who are you aiming to build for?

780
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,260
Just what should people know about the future of a book?

781
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:32,100
If there's like one thing I could say is that we are continuing to learn from users every day.

782
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,620
So please keep using it.

783
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,000
Please keep sharing your feedback, whether it's on X or on Discord.

784
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,820
Like I'm there every day.

785
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,860
Even if I don't respond, I've read everything.

786
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:48,100
And I say this in the most non creepy way possible.

787
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:55,420
But I say this because we are just very passionate about trying to build the right thing, you know, the best thing for everybody.

788
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,660
Kind of going back to sort of, hey, who are you building for?

789
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:06,240
I think that there's a lot of fun use cases, but there's a lot of actually very useful sort of game changing workflows in here.

790
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,440
And so we'll continue to build in that direction, I think, particularly for educators, for learners, for professionals, right?

791
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,020
Knowledge workers, as we call them.

792
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,240
I think there's a lot there that we'll be able to execute against in the very short term.

793
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:18,060
Amazing.

794
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,480
OK, two final questions.

795
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:23,960
If folks want to give you feedback, reach out, what's the best way to do that?

796
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,640
Is it DM you?

797
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,580
Is it is there an email?

798
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,340
Something else?

799
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,640
Yeah, I mean, Discord.

800
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:29,520
Join our Discord.

801
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,640
Time in.

802
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,260
Yeah, we're there.

803
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,920
You can ask me or yeah, X also.

804
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:34,620
It's pretty good.

805
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:38,220
I just I just came back to it and kind of feel like I don't really know how it works now.

806
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,900
So just a warning in case you DM me.

807
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,840
I might just not know how it works.

808
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,060
On Twitter, you mean specifically?

809
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:44,840
On Twitter, on Twitter.

810
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:45,360
Exactly.

811
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,520
And then final question, how can listeners be useful to you?

812
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,720
I mean, please keep trying it.

813
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,280
Try it.

814
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,060
Share your feedback.

815
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,760
Whether you find it useful, not useful, you think it's annoying.

816
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:55,420
Tell me.

817
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:59,320
These are the things that I've heard, you know, for the last year that's helped me to make it better.

818
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,120
And so if you're inclined, please go ahead.

819
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:02,600
Try it.

820
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,540
Notebooklm.google.com.

821
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,080
You're building an amazing product that is extremely delightful.

822
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,020
It's one of the most interesting things on the Internet today, which is a very high bar.

823
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,260
And you've done it.

824
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,880
And I'm really excited to see where it goes.

825
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,900
I'm going to keep playing with it.

826
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,080
I've been using it for my newsletter in a really fun way.

827
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,440
And so great work and keep it up.

828
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,720
And we'll see where things go.

829
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,960
Thanks for thanks for coming on.

830
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:24,960
I know you have a lot of work to do.

831
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,140
Oh, that's amazing.

832
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:26,680
Thank you, Lenny.

833
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,620
Thanks for having me.
