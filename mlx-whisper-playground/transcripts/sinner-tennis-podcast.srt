!

37
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,460
Hello and welcome to the Tennis Podcast on Monday the 30th of September.

38
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,460
Introduced beautifully there by Marnie.

39
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,460
Marnie says, as a bit of backstory here,

40
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,460
it was very exciting to finally meet you at the US Open this year.

41
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,460
I remember meeting Marnie.

42
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,460
She says, after several years and two continents of looking for you,

43
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,460
we finally ticked that box.

44
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,460
She says her husband, Edwin,

45
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:02,460
and she started listening to the podcast after reading the New York Times article about the pod.

46
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,460
She says she's proud to be a friend for the last few years.

47
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,460
First picked up a racket ten years ago at the age of 48,

48
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,460
and she absolutely loves it.

49
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,460
She says she'd play every day if she could.

50
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,460
She says, thanks for helping me grow my appreciation of the sport, its history,

51
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,460
and the people in and around the sport through the relived pods.

52
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,460
I cleaned up the intro this year, she says, so there's no confusion.

53
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,460
Even though I live in Houston, I will always be from New Orleans.

54
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:37,460
And that jogs my memory, Marnie, of the debate we had surrounding your intro last year.

55
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:43,460
So appreciate that and appreciate your lovely, lilting Southern accent

56
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,460
and your brilliant introduction to the show there.

57
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,460
And of course, if you, dear listener, would like to introduce a show,

58
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,460
then you can do so by becoming a friend of the tennis podcast at intro level,

59
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,460
and you can get access to all of those tennis relived pods

60
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,460
and all of the other bonus content that we produce throughout the year as well.

61
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,460
And that, as always, is in our show notes.

62
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,460
David is here. Hello, David.

63
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,460
Hello. Hello. Yes.

64
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,460
And I'm a bit happier than I was a week ago when I was immediately complaining about the weather.

65
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:23,460
It hasn't picked up. I've just found my hot water bottles and I'm cuddling them as we speak.

66
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,460
Yes, which makes them sound sort of furry and cosy.

67
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:36,460
I can tell you folks, they're not. They look sort of, they're quite medical looking in appearance, I would say.

68
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,460
But as long as they're serving a purpose for you, David.

69
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,460
I'm quite new to hot water bottles, so I didn't know they came in different sort of textures.

70
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,460
Just after the sheer heat of it all.

71
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,460
Well, they usually have a little jacket on, don't they? You've got just the innards.

72
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,460
Yes.

73
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,460
But anyway, so long as you're warm, we're all happy.

74
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,460
Matt, how are you? Warm, I hope.

75
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,460
I am warm. I'm wearing my tennis podcast hoodie,

76
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,460
which is normally what you're rocking on one of these podcasts, Catherine.

77
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,460
I thought we were going to be dressed the same on Zoom, but no.

78
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,460
This is a rare week where you're not wearing this exclusive tennis podcast hoodie.

79
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:24,460
Sorry, that sounded like a bit of a dig to suggest that you only ever wear one item of clothing,

80
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,460
but it wasn't meant to be.

81
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,460
Well, I am wearing Wimbledon merch, so...

82
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,460
That's the other thing you'll wear.

83
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,460
Yeah, it's probably a fair dig.

84
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,460
Certainly a fair genre of dig, anyway.

85
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,460
Folks, it is a complicated week in terms of tennis.

86
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,460
The tournaments that we're watching at the moment, none of them have finished.

87
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,460
One of them is finishing on Wednesday.

88
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,460
Some of them are going for another week.

89
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,460
It's all very confusing.

90
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,460
And we, of course, will be covering off the results from the events that hadn't finished last week

91
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,460
at the time of recording.

92
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:08,460
We'll cover off what we've seen of Beijing on the men's and women's sides and of Tokyo so far.

93
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:17,460
And we will be back with a bonus pod this week on Thursday because lots of tennis is happening at weird times.

94
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,460
So we're going to make sure we cover that for you.

95
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,460
So we'll be getting into all of that today and on Thursday.

96
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:31,460
But I think we have to start with the news that dropped on Saturday morning out of nowhere.

97
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,460
For me, I certainly didn't hear of anybody that knew this was coming.

98
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:44,460
The news that the World Anti-Doping Agency are appealing the decision to clear Yannick Sinner of blame

99
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,460
after he twice tested positive for a banned substance.

100
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:56,460
WADA say that last month's ruling by an independent tribunal to fine the Italian World No. 1 had no fault or negligence was, quote,

101
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,460
not correct under the applicable rules.

102
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:06,460
It is appealed to the court of arbitration for sport and said Sinner should be banned for between one and two years,

103
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:20,460
although they aren't seeking any retroactive action and they aren't seeking to discredit any of the results that have happened since those positive tests,

104
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:29,460
i.e. there is no question here whatever the outcome of this appeal of the US Open victory being taken off the books, as it were.

105
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,460
Yannick Sinner released the following statement in response to the news.

106
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,460
He said he's disappointed here that WADA have chosen to appeal the results of the ITIA hearing

107
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,460
after the independent judges had exonerated me and deemed me to be innocent.

108
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:52,460
Over the past few months and throughout this process, there have been three separate hearings in each case confirming my innocence.

109
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,460
Several months of interviews and investigations culminated in three senior judges scrutinising every detail through a formal hearing.

110
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:07,460
They issued an in-depth judgment explaining why they determined me not at fault with clear evidence provided and my cooperation throughout.

111
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:15,460
On the back of such a robust process, both the ITIA and the Italian Anti-Doping Authority accepted it and waived their rights to appeal.

112
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,460
I understand these things need to be thoroughly investigated to maintain the integrity of the sport we all love.

113
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:29,460
However, it is difficult to see what will be gained by asking a different set of three judges to look at the same facts and documentation all over again.

114
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:35,460
That being said, I have nothing to hide. And as I have done throughout the summer, I will cooperate fully with the appeal process

115
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,460
and provide whatever may be needed to prove my innocence once again.

116
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,460
As the case is now pending before Cass, I won't comment further.

117
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:54,460
Now, he states there that the process that's already taken place, the International Tennis Integrity Unit hearing deemed him to be innocent.

118
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,460
Now, according to one interpretation, which is obviously Yannick Sinner's interpretation, that is true.

119
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,460
Innocent, he was cleared of any intentional wrongdoing.

120
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:24,460
Now, from what I can gather, David, of reading what's come out from WADA, what is at issue here is the extent to which Yannick Sinner is responsible for the actions of his team.

121
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,460
Is that your interpretation as well?

122
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,460
It is, because, look, he had it in his system.

123
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,460
So it's not as though he was just completely found innocent.

124
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:46,460
Yes, he was found innocent of wrongdoing, of he wasn't found guilty of negligence, as we hear there.

125
00:08:46,460 --> 00:09:03,460
But I can understand why another body looking at the same facts might take the view that, well, you are responsible for the people you hire and they are responsible for having put this in your system.

126
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:10,460
So, therefore, you are responsible for its existence in your system as well.

127
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,460
I don't think it's a cut and dried case.

128
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:20,460
And therefore, I'm not actually that surprised that two groups are coming up with different views of this.

129
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,460
And where I would, I mean, on one level, I do feel for him.

130
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,460
It's obviously stressful.

131
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,460
It's obviously wearing.

132
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,460
We heard from him during the US Open.

133
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:39,460
We found him to be very compelling and kind of convincing in the way that he explained everything.

134
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,460
And then he came and he won the US Open.

135
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,460
But two things that strike me.

136
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:55,460
One, the idea, as he says, it's difficult to see what will be gained by asking a different set of judges to look at the same facts and documentation all over again.

137
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,460
Well, in that case, you're just completely refuting the idea of appeals.

138
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:07,460
You're effectively saying, what's the point of appeals given I've already been found innocent of negligence?

139
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:22,460
So if the shoes on the other foot, therefore, if you got if you got done, are you saying you wouldn't want an appeal because there some judges have already found you innocent or already found you guilty rather?

140
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,460
You know, that's that's that's that's one thing.

141
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,460
And I don't know.

142
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:43,460
I think that the thing with this is now, if if he does end up having this upheld and doesn't and gets banned, obviously, if you were to be banned, that's that's significant impact to his career.

143
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:53,460
But I do think historically you would then have to look at his US Open with an asterisk, even if they're not taking it away from him and they're not seeking to disqualify it.

144
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,460
Everybody would know that the end result.

145
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:04,460
If it had been found in the first instance, would would have meant you wouldn't have competed in that US Open.

146
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,460
So so this is this is massively significant.

147
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:14,460
Now, he may well now get this this appeal heard and refuted as well.

148
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,460
So he may end up coming out in exactly the same position.

149
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,460
And then that would be that.

150
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,460
But it might not.

151
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,460
And there's going to be a period now he is eligible to play.

152
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,460
But and I understand why he doesn't want to talk about it anymore while this is ongoing.

153
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:38,460
But it does mean that every time he plays, that just has to be in the back of your mind somewhere, because this is pending.

154
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,460
And and who knows how long this is going to take?

155
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:48,460
You know, I spent quite a long time with with the communications officer for the International Tennis Integrity Agency during the US Open.

156
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:59,460
And and I just heard just how difficult these these cases are to to to to undergo and put together and how long it takes.

157
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:06,460
And I and I was saying, well, why don't you and Cass spend time together and work it out and and get a get more of a common idea?

158
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,460
And and he said they don't want to speak.

159
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,460
We don't have any contact with them at all.

160
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,460
They won't they won't talk to us.

161
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,460
So, yeah, who knows how long this is going to take?

162
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:32,460
And look, in terms of it it weighing on him, we just watched him beat Yuri Lahechka 6276 to reach the semifinals in Beijing, just as we now know was the case throughout the summer and was winning Cincinnati.

163
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:55,460
And his on court results so far seem remarkably untouched by by this off court drama is an interesting point you make about sort of the appeals process and sort of what's the point in in different eyes looking at the same case in in the court of law to appeal.

164
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,460
You do have to have fresh evidence.

165
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:04,460
You can't just ask for someone else to have a different different look at a case and see if they view it differently.

166
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,460
You have to present something something new.

167
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,460
But I believe that's not the case in this situation.

168
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:20,460
What they're actually not asking the evidence to be reexamined in terms of what happened is my understanding.

169
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

170
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

171
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

172
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

173
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

174
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

175
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

176
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

177
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

178
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

179
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

180
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

181
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

182
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

183
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

184
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

185
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

186
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

187
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

188
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

189
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

190
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

191
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

192
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

193
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

194
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

195
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

196
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

197
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

198
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

199
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,460
I think that's not the case in this situation.

200
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:13,460
Maybe we are due an examination of this bigger picture issue.

201
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,460
And it does sound like that is going to be at the heart of this

202
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,460
Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing.

203
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,460
Absolutely.

204
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:29,460
And I suppose I was probably quite quick to just very much kind of agree

205
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,460
with what Yannick Sinner said during that US Open, which was,

206
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,460
we know the source.

207
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,460
It was members of my team.

208
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,460
And I've got rid of those team members.

209
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,460
And, you know, I sort of took Sinner's word on that.

210
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,460
But it is an important question, I suppose.

211
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,460
If you accept, as the ITIA and WADA both do,

212
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,460
that Sinner himself didn't intend to enhance his performance,

213
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:01,460
then there's still a couple of possible plausible scenarios

214
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,460
which need examining.

215
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:09,460
There's a situation where his fitness trainer and physio at the time,

216
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,460
and Bartow Ferrara and Iacomo Naldi didn't intend to enhance Sinner's performance.

217
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:22,460
But Naldi unknowingly massaged Sinner with Klosterball from the spray that Ferrara had bought.

218
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,460
And so it was all a complete accident.

219
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,460
But that's why Sinner tested positive.

220
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,460
And that's what the team have said happened.

221
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:43,460
But there's also scenario B where it was intentional on the part of Sinner's team to enhance his performance behind Sinner's back,

222
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,460
but using Klosterball to help him gain an edge.

223
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,460
Now, we don't know the answer to that.

224
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,460
It's not what's on trial.

225
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,460
But the question of whether Sinner, as the employer of those team members,

226
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,460
is responsible for their actions is the crux of this.

227
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:11,460
And I think it's reasonable that WADA, a different body, has come to a different conclusion

228
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:18,460
because you don't want a sport where scenario B is happening all the time.

229
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:24,460
And to prevent that, one way might be to say that a player is responsible

230
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:31,460
and should face consequences for their team's actions, no matter whether they knew about it or not,

231
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:38,460
and no matter whether those actions from the team were intentional or not.

232
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:44,460
Yeah, like just optically, this news dropping was pretty shocking

233
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:49,460
because it felt like Beijing was kind of the moment for Yannick Sinner to move on from this

234
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,460
because he's literally sitting there with his new team members,

235
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:00,460
Marco Panicci and Ulysses Badio, who are very familiar from a coaching box perspective

236
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,460
because they've been in Novak Djokovic's box for a long, long time.

237
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,460
And he's hired the people that Novak Djokovic had with him to replace Ferrara and Naldi.

238
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:14,460
And he's sort of literally on court with them in this sort of moving on from the case.

239
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:22,460
And yet this news drops and we know how much, OK, it hasn't affected his results, as we've seen.

240
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,460
He's currently on a 14 match winning streak.

241
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,460
He was winning things before the world knew about this case.

242
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,460
He was winning things after the world knew about this case.

243
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,460
But we know that it's taken a toll on him personally.

244
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,460
You know, he's spoken about that and how he has, you know, sort of shrunk his world.

245
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,460
And I feel like eventually that might sort of catch up with him.

246
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:52,460
And it's just sort of it's a lot for him to to be processing and have going on right now.

247
00:17:52,460 --> 00:18:01,460
And yeah, like for sure, it's a big moment, because if if the world number one ends up getting banned for a long time,

248
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,460
then we've obviously got this, you know, that changes the complexion of men's tennis going forward.

249
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:15,460
And as David said, it would it would change how we view this year as well, because if Wilder's verdict had been come to in the first place,

250
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,460
then he wouldn't have been playing the US Open that he ended up winning.

251
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,460
So it's a massive moment for the sport.

252
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:30,460
And I think you're absolutely right that it does raise that huge question of how responsible are our players for the actions of their team members.

253
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:47,460
You know, we we credit coaches, don't we, when when when players do good things on court and therefore should we be holding the players responsible when their coaches maybe do something that's that's wrong,

254
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,460
like like they've done in this case or not his coaches, but his, you know, his team.

255
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,460
So it's it's incredibly complicated that that question.

256
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:03,460
And I'm not I suppose the issue I have is like there isn't a clear cut answer.

257
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,460
So if he does end up getting banned, it will kind of feel a little bit unfair.

258
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:13,460
And if he doesn't end up getting banned, you also think, well, maybe that's kind of wrong as well.

259
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:20,460
Like just such a such a difficult place to come down on one side, I think, which makes it so hard.

260
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:30,460
Yeah, I agree. I think if if Wada win this appeal, I will have a lot of sympathy for Yannick Sinner a lot.

261
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:40,460
But equally, I think it's very important for the integrity of the sport going forward that it is not possible.

262
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,460
And I'm absolutely not suggesting this is what's happened with Yannick Sinner.

263
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:49,460
I'm just saying that this principle of the responsibility you have for your team.

264
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:59,460
I think I think this could set quite a precedent because I as I was saying, I think it's very important for the integrity of the sport, any sport,

265
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,460
that it is not possible just to have a don't ask, don't tell policy with the people you employ.

266
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:19,460
Because I do think that opens a gateway to to a defense, cheating defense, basically to, you know, I'm employing you.

267
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,460
Just make me the best tennis player I can be. I don't need I don't need to know the details.

268
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:36,460
So I think it's very, very important that that is not possible and admissible within the rules.

269
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:46,460
But for Yannick Sinner to potentially be the landmark case to set that example and make that statement is is quite a thing.

270
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:56,460
And David, well, you've touched upon it in terms of, you know, looking how the US Open victory would be viewed if this wider appeal is successful.

271
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:02,460
But this is just a disaster for tennis, isn't it? It just looks so bad for tennis.

272
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:09,460
If the appeal is successful, it'll look bad for the tennis integrity agency. It'll look bad for tennis.

273
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:23,460
It'll make records a nightmare. You know, whenever you see a graphic of numbers of Grand Slams won, you'll always do a bit of mental gymnastics for the US Open asterisk.

274
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,460
Will there be a world number one asterisk? It's just a nightmare for the sport.

275
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:47,460
Yeah, nobody's winning here at all. I do share your view about somehow the need to get to a bit more of a conclusive view over what is and isn't negligence and just have that as the rule so that everybody understands where they where they are.

276
00:21:47,460 --> 00:22:06,360
But but but but you're right. I mean, having spent this time with with the rep, Adrian Bassett from the International Tennis Integrity Agency, I mean, he was saying, you know, we'll we'd be happy to have you in and talk to you about you could grill us speak to us about any elements of this that you want.

277
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,100
You know, we obviously we can't talk about specific cases, but how we work and all this sort of stuff.

278
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:27,620
You can you can you can feel their frustration at not being able to to to to be to have the trust of the sport and the fans and the players and everybody in the way that they'd love the process to have the trust.

279
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:43,000
And I'm afraid there isn't there isn't a way you can trust feel completely confident given the number of cases that are going to Cass and just being completely overruled with massive discrepancies.

280
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,380
See the Salona Halep case. So, yeah, well, all we can do is wait, wait and find out what comes out of this.

281
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,520
But it's it's a big blow. No question.

282
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,540
She's she's she's due to start playing again next week.

283
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,220
I think Halep, isn't she? Did I did I see that?

284
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:58,940
No, that's right.

285
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,400
I mean, interesting off the court on the court, but obviously off the court.

286
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,860
That means, you know, she's going to be doing some press, isn't she?

287
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,380
Yeah.

288
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:15,800
Well, we might get to hear more of her views on on a thing or two.

289
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,680
OK, well, look, we will follow that very closely and keep you posted on it.

290
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:28,400
There is no timeline at the moment for that hearing, as is well documented.

291
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,680
It's very much a how long is a piece of string thing.

292
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,760
So for the moment, it hangs over the sport and it hangs over Yannick Sinner.

293
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,660
Should we stay in the vaguely legal domain?

294
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,580
Why not?

295
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,900
For our next news item.

296
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:50,820
Wimbledon's plans to expand.

297
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:58,640
This is from various reporting in the UK press, including on the BBC and The Guardian.

298
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:10,580
And from me personally, I attended some of this hearing virtually before deciding it was simply too boring and tapping out to go for a wet dog walk.

299
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,120
But I did do some hashtag journalism here.

300
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:25,740
Wimbledon's expansion plans have been given the green light after the deputy mayor of London, Jules Pipe, ruled at the end of a three hour public hearing at City Hall that the, quote,

301
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:31,380
very significant benefits of the scheme outweighed any potential harm to the environment.

302
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,220
And there were some protesters present.

303
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:44,660
There were some boos from the gallery when this verdict came down, a verdict that had felt a bit of a foregone conclusion on the day.

304
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:50,760
Certainly there had been some briefing going on that this was going to be the likely outcome.

305
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,640
But there were protests.

306
00:24:52,780 --> 00:25:10,640
And I know, you know, from personal experience, there is a strong depth of feeling from those that are opposed, including the local MP, Fleur Anderson, who remains opposed to the plan and spoke on Friday against it.

307
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:19,360
The plans include growing from 41 to 115 hectares on the site of the old Wimbledon Park golf course.

308
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,840
Do you think there's any other countries in the world that use hectares as a unit of measurement?

309
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,840
Does anybody outside of the UK know what we're talking about?

310
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,740
Do I even know what we're talking about?

311
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,020
I wrote it in the agenda and have absolutely no concept of what it means.

312
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:39,840
It's getting bigger.

313
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,040
It's getting bigger.

314
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,360
That's what I can tell you.

315
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,820
You are welcome.

316
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,740
Almost trebling, almost trebling in size.

317
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,760
According to my maths.

318
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:01,420
They're building 39 new courts, including one 8000 seater permanent structure that'll have a roof.

319
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:07,340
They'll be bringing qualifying on site and allowing 10,000 people a day to attend.

320
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,720
That's up from the 2000 people a day that are able to attend qualifying currently at Roehampton.

321
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,120
It'll increase the grounds capacity to 50,000 per day during the main championships.

322
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,960
And they'll be upgrading the facilities for all the players.

323
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,380
The AELTC's chief executive, Sally Bolton, is thrilled, obviously.

324
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,240
It's fantastic news, she says.

325
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,380
We've got some legal agreements to work through.

326
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,980
Then we can look forward to delivering one of the greatest transformations since the London Games,

327
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,660
which I think we're all very excited about delivering.

328
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,360
There is still the possibility of a judicial review, an appeal, essentially.

329
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:59,360
An attempt could be made to challenge the lawfulness of the way the decision was made on the grounds of illegality, procedural unfairness or irrationality.

330
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:04,600
But the bar remains high as any very small number of these cases succeed each year.

331
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:12,420
I think it's fewer than 10% in terms of judicial reviews that are accepted.

332
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:22,060
So I guess no one will relax, given the bumpy road that this has been until the threat of judicial review is gone.

333
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:28,500
But it looks almost certainly like this is happening.

334
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:36,660
And look, as I said, there is strong feeling against locally.

335
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,080
But we are a tennis podcast.

336
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,500
And in terms of tennis and Wimbledon, this is good news, David.

337
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,440
Yeah.

338
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,700
I mean, I do try to keep that in mind.

339
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:53,100
But on a very selfish level, as somebody who cares about the sport, this is brilliant news.

340
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,040
I'm not personally affected by it in the area.

341
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,160
I understand that.

342
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,940
Obviously, there is a green belt question mark that some would have.

343
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,180
And I understand that.

344
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:20,640
Although the plans that I've seen and people that I've spoken to, it does feel like there's a real understanding of the importance of creating parkland within this new development.

345
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:34,500
And I mean, I just cannot believe that Wimbledon won't make this beautiful and special and really something and ultimately way, way better than it was before.

346
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:42,020
And from a sporting perspective, I think Debbie Jevons, the chair, is absolutely right.

347
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:53,960
And it's become more apparent than ever this year that Wimbledon was falling behind in terms of that third week in particular.

348
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:05,140
You know, it's been creeping for a while, ever since the Australian Open first started staging practice matches in the lead up to the Australian Open.

349
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:10,680
And then the US Open starting to try to launch its fan week.

350
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:22,180
But it was when the French Open opened up qualifying to everybody and started sticking the whole thing in court, Susan Longland for 12,000 people to come out and watch first round qualifying.

351
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,660
That I just knew that, OK, Grand Slam's are three weeks now.

352
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,480
And they're constantly trying to one up each other.

353
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:47,580
And even assuming all of this goes ahead as planned and is available for Wimbledon between 2030 and 2033, imagine how much progress these other Grand Slams are going to make in the next six to nine years on developing their week before.

354
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:59,080
Now, I think because Wimbledon will be building at the same time, I can only imagine how special it will be the day that Wimbledon finally opens the doors for that extra week.

355
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:11,020
And I suspect that all of those six to nine years, you will then on that moment think, ah, OK, we see where all this has been building towards.

356
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,360
It's to this moment and it's worth it.

357
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:20,300
But they're going to have to put up with another six to nine years of frustration whilst all the other Grand Slam's are making strides.

358
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:31,620
I think as long as this goes through, they will be able to think and we will all be able to think, yeah, but at least they're able to do it now and it'll be worth it in the end.

359
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,320
But, yeah, I think the stakes are really quite high for Wimbledon here.

360
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,380
Huge, in fact.

361
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:42,920
And in terms of judicial review, we will, of course, keep you posted.

362
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:49,340
That's it for the legal segment of the podcast, the procedural segment.

363
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:56,200
A couple of other bits of news before we talk about results from the week that has just been.

364
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:02,420
Rafael Nadal has been picked for Spain's Davis Cup finals squad.

365
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:08,660
Could we get the Alca, no, oh, no.

366
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,200
Nadal Caraz.

367
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:22,580
Could we get the Nadal Caraz, Nadal retirement that we deserve, Matt, in Malaga?

368
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:34,640
Well, as I said before, Spain literally have the doubles world number one at the moment, who is Marcel Granollas.

369
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:42,540
And yet, I think, yes, I think we probably will get Nadal and Alca's doubles if it comes to that.

370
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:50,140
I mean, if you're David Ferrer, how could you not pick that team if it's available to you?

371
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,040
Like, I just think that would be incredibly hard to resist.

372
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,460
Alca has certainly spoke about this in Beijing and Alca has is up for it.

373
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,540
He said he missed Nadal at Leiva Cup and he hopes to play with him in Malaga.

374
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:16,520
I think that probably probably is the only way we would be seeing Nadal like actually play barring injury.

375
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:22,960
I just think, you know, indoor hard court has never been Nadal's best surface anyway.

376
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,820
And obviously, Alca has is an absolute lock to play singles.

377
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:33,920
And Roberto Bautista Agu in the last few weeks has started winning some, you know, some quite impressive matches again.

378
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,620
And he's probably going to be their number two singles player, I would have thought.

379
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:48,760
So, you know, David Ferrer, when he announced this team, he very much saved Nadal till last and put him in as the as the kind of fifth pick.

380
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,700
And I think he's there in that role.

381
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,460
He's he's going to bring the vibes.

382
00:32:52,460 --> 00:33:01,120
He's going to bring the energy and if he's available and ready to play doubles, he's going to be fired up and most likely taken to court in the doubles.

383
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,580
I suppose there's potentially a chance that we see Nadal and Granoyes.

384
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,780
Like because Alcares has not shown himself to be a particularly brilliant doubles player.

385
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,340
But as I said, how can you resist Nadal and Alcares?

386
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:29,500
I don't think Ferrer is the guy that's going to go, Carlos, sorry, no, you're on the bench for this one.

387
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,380
Marcel, you're on.

388
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:36,080
I just I just don't think David Ferrer is is going to do that.

389
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,260
Matt, you're.

390
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,500
Great options though, aren't they?

391
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:39,760
Yes.

392
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,580
You know, you've suddenly actually got yourself some options there.

393
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:48,500
Like if Nadal and Alcares got a little tweak or something like that.

394
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:55,120
Or if he's played like a three and a half hour singles match and, you know, they need to protect him a little bit.

395
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:04,580
Like you're being very dismissive, Matt, of the Saudi Kings because Nadal is the, I think, second seed at the Saudi Kings.

396
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,260
He's scheduled to play singles.

397
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,060
Is that right?

398
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:07,840
Wow.

399
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,380
In just a few weeks time.

400
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:09,900
Yeah.

401
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:16,120
Nadal and Djokovic are the top seeds suspiciously and they get a bye through to the semifinals.

402
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:22,940
This is the exhibition tournament featuring.

403
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,780
Like a bus pass.

404
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:36,220
Featuring six, six top male tennis players, although Holger Rune should have very pleased to be their energy throughout the entire experience.

405
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,260
I've just watched him lose to a sort of one legged artifice.

406
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:40,660
Yeah.

407
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,680
Yeah.

408
00:34:43,840 --> 00:35:01,060
And I mentioned it because, well, the draw came out this week, but also their eye-wateringly expensive looking promo feature film dropped this week and is making some waves on the internet.

409
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,780
And Nadal is playing.

410
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,380
Singles.

411
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,720
Second seed.

412
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:09,580
Yes.

413
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:15,140
That's what being Saudi Arabia's tennis ambassador gets you, I suppose.

414
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,400
The second seed in that.

415
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,820
I think they've done seeding on the basis of age and injury from what I can gather.

416
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,980
Number of grand slam titles.

417
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,360
Who is physically able to play three matches?

418
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,500
No, not you two?

419
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:27,960
Okay.

420
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:28,740
Right.

421
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:31,920
Yeah.

422
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,220
I mean, some people are going nuts for this promo video.

423
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,800
And look, it's, as I said, it's dripping in money.

424
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:53,220
But all I saw when I watched it was sort of sadness that, oh, well, people do have, like, just all this money being spent on tennis that's being spent on that tennis by those people.

425
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,860
Like, oh, this is what's possible.

426
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:02,600
Can't we have some cleaner, cleaner, less problematic money?

427
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,500
I don't know.

428
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,600
Just depressing, isn't it?

429
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,080
But anyway, I digress.

430
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:15,200
We will get to see, hopefully, some wholesome Nadal Karaz in November in Malaga.

431
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,520
Last bit of news before we move on to results and on-court stuff.

432
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,520
Bit of a tough one here.

433
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,640
A social media post from Caroline Garcia announcing that she's shutting down her season.

434
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:38,080
She says, I'm tired of living in a world where my worth is measured by last week's results, my ranking, or my unforced errors.

435
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,800
Mentally, I need a reset.

436
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,600
I need to step away from the constant grind of tennis.

437
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,440
I'm exhausted from the anxiety, the panic attacks, the tears before matches.

438
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,940
I'm tired of missing out on family moments and never having a place to truly call home.

439
00:36:53,100 --> 00:37:00,260
Physically, I've been pushing my shoulder to its limit, trying to recover while competing, and it's just not working.

440
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,740
I need more time off to heal properly.

441
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,400
In my mind, I've been stuck on what I haven't achieved.

442
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,460
I never made it to number one, never won a single slam, never reached an Olympic podium.

443
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,480
I've been inconsistent, unable to stay in the top ten for a full year.

444
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,280
I'm choosing to step away now.

445
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,500
I'm taking a few weeks off to recharge.

446
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:27,200
Then I'll start preparing for 2025 early, getting ready physically, mentally, and tactically.

447
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,820
It's a bit of a kind of portrait of a modern tennis player, that, isn't it?

448
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,100
Because so many lines in there are familiar.

449
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:48,840
Thankfully, some of them are familiar from players who have kind of been through that emotional experience of feeling like their worth is measured by their results.

450
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:57,280
And having come out on the other side, or at least kind of mentally worked through those feelings in therapy or whatever.

451
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:03,480
But it was alarming how familiar those words felt to me.

452
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:08,240
And I don't know what the answer is, because it is just an unbelievably demanding sport.

453
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:33,040
But it's difficult to know whether this is a worsening situation or whether it is players, people generally now have better language for these things and feel more able to express these things publicly, which is a very, very good thing that we're hearing about this more.

454
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,780
And we should make, therefore, more accommodation for it.

455
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,080
But it is alarming, David.

456
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:49,180
Yeah, as you were reading those quotes out, I was thinking they feel like the definitive version of what it is like to be a tennis player behind the scenes.

457
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,180
If you actually look in the mirror and are honest with yourself about how you're feeling.

458
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,820
On the negative side, listen, there are loads of positive sides to this as well, to being a tennis player.

459
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:07,740
But so often, even now, so often you get the Instagram version of what it is like to be a tennis player.

460
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:13,420
And I think, really, over the years, that's what we've got more often than not with Caroline Garcia.

461
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,320
She has her own hashtag, Fly With Caro.

462
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:25,760
And she's often sort of following up a loss with a tweet which says, on to the next one, and all the rest of it, which, of course, you have to feel as well.

463
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:32,020
But I've often got the feeling that, really, are you able to just put it behind you as quickly as that?

464
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:42,740
And, I mean, in more recent times, I have seen other posts from her, and she's got her own podcast in which she's obviously, she's often examining mental health with other tennis players.

465
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:51,020
But right here, I feel like you've got from her what has probably, well, what has been going on in her mind and in the background all along.

466
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,000
And which I think is probably going on for a lot of players.

467
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:09,200
And if you ask, well, what's the kind of plus side, what's the end game to something like this, what's the answer, maybe it's for other players to have to read what she's got to say as somebody who's been on the tour for 10 years.

468
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:25,020
And for them to acknowledge the dangers and the risks and the sort of the importance of taking breaks and not just giving in to the tour treadmill.

469
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:32,340
You know, we always say there's too much tennis and we sometimes have a go for players for them playing exhibitions.

470
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,420
It's still not the same, is it?

471
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,120
You could, if you want, you can take a break.

472
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,340
And yes, you may take a rankings hit.

473
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:54,780
And I do think maybe the sport needs to look at ways of not clobbering people rankings wise or financially if they don't turn up at a tournament so that they can have breaks more easily.

474
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:12,000
But I do think empowering players, empowering teams and families to be able to look at the words of Caroline Garcia and think, you know what, I think you're at risk of what she's describing there or I'm at risk of it and I need to stop for a bit.

475
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,140
And I think that that should hopefully be helped by what she's just done.

476
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:32,060
Yeah. And just on the subject of players playing exhibitions and thus kind of weakening their argument about the amount of tennis and the length of the season and the demands of that on modern players.

477
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:38,000
A few male players have talked about that this week.

478
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,520
It does feel like that's coming to the fore a bit as a talking point.

479
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:53,900
Taylor Fritz made the point on Twitter that exhibitions just are not comparable to tour events in terms of the mental and physical fatigue.

480
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,680
He says, an exo, you show up, have some fun and entertain for a match or two.

481
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,660
You don't have to all out push your body and there is absolutely zero mental fatigue or stress.

482
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:13,720
In a lot of ways, an exo is a lot like a rest week, he says, and shouldn't be compared with a tour event.

483
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:23,280
I don't expect non-players to fully comprehend what I mean by this because it's tough to judge the mental and physical fatigue that playing at tour weeks entails if you're not a part of it.

484
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,400
But I would fully expect players to understand what I mean by this.

485
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,180
And I do think that's a valid point.

486
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:44,600
I still don't think it's the same as, you know, a proper break from the sport or even a proper block of time to make technical adjustments to your game.

487
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,240
I mean, that's simply not really possible without taking a break from the sport at the moment.

488
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,000
But I do think that's a valid point Taylor Fritz makes that we should take into consideration.

489
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,940
Denis Shapovalov made a slightly different defence of exhibitions.

490
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:08,500
He said, in my opinion, if players would make decent money during the season, they wouldn't feel the need to play exos in off weeks.

491
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,460
Instead, players, aside from maybe the top 20, only make decent money four times a year.

492
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,400
Slams.

493
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,820
So it's a no-brainer for players to play exos for good cash.

494
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:29,080
And then in reply to somebody else, he said, who was pointing out, you know, how much money tennis players make.

495
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,340
He said, yeah, but take up taxes, percentages, salaries and expenses we play.

496
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,920
Tennis isn't like other sports where you keep the money you make.

497
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,920
There are a lot of costs as a tennis player.

498
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:45,040
Not saying we don't make money, just that we make much more money than much more money playing exos.

499
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:53,900
Not saying there isn't a grain of validity in that, but just a couple of counterpoints to Denis Shapovalov there.

500
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,500
Number one, like it is the top 20 players in the world that generally are invited to play exhibitions.

501
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:05,620
Like Liam Brody ain't getting invited to play many exhibitions.

502
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:11,660
It is the top players that the Saudi kings want to come and play.

503
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,260
Sorry, the kings are the players themselves, aren't we?

504
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:21,080
It is the Saudi kings, Nadal and Djokovic et al, that are paid the big bucks for exhibitions.

505
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:29,920
And number two, last time I checked, which was this week, so it's possible the internet isn't up to date,

506
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,060
but Denis Shapovalov lives in Bahamas, which is a tax haven.

507
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,580
And even if he didn't live in a tax haven, like, yeah, we all pay taxes, mate.

508
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,660
That's a thing for everyone.

509
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,920
I think that's a really fun new pod segment.

510
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,800
Catherine community notes.

511
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,520
Well, any tennis player's tweets, but Denis Shapovalov's in particular.

512
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:04,100
Did you see Sitsapass's tweet this week about the schedule, which was just lifted from AI,

513
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:10,940
just fully, fully just written by AI, chatty Cathy or something?

514
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:19,560
I don't know what it is, but like, because I will read a 1,000 word article or 500 word article, no problem.

515
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,740
But if I see a tweet that's longer than 280 characters, I just don't read it.

516
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,280
It's just too, it's just not the place.

517
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,360
He wrote an absolute essay on there.

518
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,220
And I just couldn't get through any of it.

519
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:34,260
He didn't.

520
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,860
And, no.

521
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,600
No, he lifted it from AI.

522
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,500
He could have said to AI, make it a length that Matt Roberts feels comfortable with.

523
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,080
AI would have been capable of that.

524
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,120
Am I the only one, though?

525
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,420
Do you not feel that when you see a really long tweet?

526
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,540
You just immediately just go, oh, close it.

527
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,120
It's just, yeah.

528
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,260
Not what I came here for.

529
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:59,320
The reason you have to click for more, Matt, is because they're not designed to be read like that.

530
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,100
Yeah, agreed.

531
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,700
Right, that's your news for this week.

532
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,780
We'll be back in part two with some tennis to talk about.

533
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,800
What a summer of sports.

534
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,680
And now it's time for the ultimate race day.

535
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,840
Kipco British Champions Day, a task at Race Sports.

536
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,100
See the sport's top styles in action as champions are crowned at the thrilling flat season finale.

537
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,860

542
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,560
But you and your potential aren't letting anything get in your way.

543

So go on, see which training option can help you make the most of your potential.

546
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,280
It all starts with skills.

547
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,000
Search skills for life.

548
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,460
Hey, I'm Jay Comfrey, host of High Performance.

549
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:21,380
And I'm excited to tell you about a brand new series we've created in collaboration with Lloyds Bank from Startup to Standout.

550
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,440
Lloyds Bank know there are plenty of British business success stories out there.

551
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:32,700
And that's why over the last few months, we've been working together to make a brand new mini series entitled From Startup to Standout.

552
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:38,820
A four episode series that sees me and the team visit a different business supported by Lloyds Bank each week,

553
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:43,140
meeting their team and understanding how they navigated those tricky early years.

554
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:49,380
So if you want to hear me visiting a company making material made from seaweed to develop new packaging solutions,

555
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:56,240
a firm changing the marketing game, a bistro run by husband and wife and a plant powered hair care brand.

556
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:05,880
Tune in to From Startup to Standout by searching for it in your podcast apps or find us on the High Performance podcast feed or on the High Performance YouTube channel.

557
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:18,160
Welcome back to the tennis podcast part two, talking about the tennis that we've seen in the last week.

558
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:25,660
None of the none of this week's tournaments have ended yet, but some of last week's tournaments did finally come to an end.

559
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:31,420
David, a week ago, we were talking about your dashed hopes of watching Marin Cilic in a final.

560
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:36,040
Well, I don't know whether you manifested it, but your dreams did come true.

561
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:45,100
You did get to see Marin Cilic in a final and he won that final, thus becoming at 777 in the world,

562
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,920
the lowest ranked ATP title winner in history.

563
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:56,480
He beat Zheng Zhijian 7-6, 7-6 to win the title in Hwangzhou.

564
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,200
Dreams do come true.

565
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,440
And it was so lovely.

566
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,060
It was so lovely to see Marin Cilic happy.

567
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:11,620
I mean, you know, I'm sure he spent lots of his last two years happy privately when he wasn't trying to come back from being a tennis player.

568
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,620
I mean, he's got a good life, I think.

569
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,600
But I haven't seen him for 20 months because he hasn't been on a tennis court and I don't see him socially.

570
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:27,440
And it's not like the paparazzi are hanging out outside his apartment to get me new pictures of Marin Cilic.

571
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:34,680
So this is the first time I've seen him in a long time and I really loved it.

572
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,500
And I actually quite enjoy watching Marin Cilic play anyway.

573
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,000
But I really thought he was finished.

574
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,640
I didn't think he'd get through this latest injury.

575
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,320
You know, 20 months is a long time, isn't it?

576
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,540
And to come out and be able to play at this level, I know it's a few weeks in the making.

577
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,680
It's not been instant.

578
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,420
But to beat a player like Zheng Zhijian like that, that's pretty impressive.

579
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,880
And then he came out and he played Nishikori this week.

580
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,780
That was excellent.

581
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,020
But yeah, he just seemed so thrilled to be back and winning a title.

582
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,600
That was quite a good tennis match, Cilic Nishikori.

583
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:17,260
I tuned in for the lols and I ended up watching it just for genuine tennis enjoyment.

584
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,080
So more fool me.

585
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:27,000
A Chinese finalist in Hwangzhou and a Chinese champion in Chengdu, Jerry Shang,

586
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:31,260
becoming the first Chinese player to win an ATP title on home soil.

587
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,600
He beat Lorenzo Mazzetti 7-6, 6-1.

588
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,880
I'd still, Matt, call that a good week for Mazzetti, reaching a hard court final.

589
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,920
But clearly an even better week for the very talented Jerry Shang.

590
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,560
Yeah, he's got a bit of a final problem, Mazzetti, at the moment.

591
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:57,260
He's reached a lot of finals this year on one level or another and he keeps losing them.

592
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,240
But I agree with you.

593
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,900
I think it is another sign of kind of the strides he's making.

594
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:07,320
Even though he was the top seed, I think Mazzetti top seed on a hard court,

595
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,640
it wouldn't really have backed him in the past to sort of even get to the final.

596
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,640
But the fact that he did was a sign that he is playing a lot better.

597
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,260
But he was outclassed in this final.

598
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:23,060
Shang probably should have won the first set before even needing a tie break.

599
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,940
He served for it and then got broken back,

600
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:31,220
but then did win that tie break and absolutely ran through the second set.

601
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,800
And he only dropped one set in the entire tournament, did Shang.

602
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,340
And like beat lots of different types of player as well.

603
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,780
Beat Nishikori in the first round who sort of,

604
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,420
that has aged a lot better than it did at the time.

605
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,940
I thought, oh, a win over Kane Nishikori.

606
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,600
But as you said, the tennis that Nishikori's been playing

607
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,220
in these past couple of weeks has been fantastic.

608
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,140
He was so good in Tokyo.

609
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,540
And Shang had beat him in Chengdu.

610
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,280
He also beat Bublik, who he's played quite a bit this year.

611
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,480
And yeah, he's, I think, the second youngest in the top 100.

612
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,140
He very nearly beat Kasper Rude at the US Open

613
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,100
before sort of fading physically.

614
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,700
But I think he's coming, Jerry Shang.

615
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,880
Like I think he's quite slight.

616
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:25,560
And I can imagine that that jump from sort of the juniors to the pros might,

617
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,500
like it's obviously going well.

618
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,620
He's young, he's 19.

619
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,760
Like it's not been a really hard transition for him.

620
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,800
But I can imagine that when he's playing these pros week in, week out,

621
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,040
he might have kind of felt that slightness, I suppose.

622
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,560
But as he continues to develop physically,

623
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,000
I think he's got the game and he's got the smarts.

624
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,940
And I just think he's going to be a bit of a star.

625
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:49,120
Like he's got charisma.

626
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,620
I think the ATP really like him.

627
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:57,060
They really use him in a lot of their social media content and videos.

628
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,820
And great for him to have a moment in his home country.

629
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,000
And yeah, he's very much sort of on the radar, I think, for next year to,

630
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,340
what is he now, around about 50 in the world.

631
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,840
I think he's going to be looking to try and get inside the top 20,

632
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,020
I would have thought, next year.

633
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,740
Kei Nishikori went on to Tokyo, as you said.

634
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,740
And there was a moment after he'd beaten Marin Cilic

635
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,160
and backed that up with a win over Jordan Thompson

636
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,380
that I got really into the Kei Nishikori comes back,

637
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,080
wins his home tournament narrative.

638
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:34,640
But by the time I got into it, it was all but over.

639
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:39,180
Ended up losing out to Holger Runa in the quarterfinals,

640
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,980
who I've just watched out, watched David,

641
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,020
and I'm sure you have as well, lose out to Artur Fies,

642
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:51,260
who now finds himself in the final to play fellow Frenchman Ugo Mbair.

643
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,520
7-6, 7-6 for Fies over Runa,

644
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,720
having beaten Ben Shelton yesterday in an extraordinary match.

645
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:02,900
On the basis of what I just saw at the end of that Runa match, though,

646
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,920
I am backing Mbair in this final

647
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,880
because he looks physically absolutely shot.

648
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,080
But whatever happens in that final,

649
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,620
and we'll cover it on Thursday's show,

650
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,360
this feels like a big week for a man.

651
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,800
Yeah, and listen, he did look pretty shot yesterday

652
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,840
against Ben Shelton at the end and came back.

653
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,100
I think this was cramp by the looks of what I saw at the end of that

654
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,960
really long tiebreak set against Holger Runa.

655
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,420
It has been a long week for Fies.

656
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,820
It's one of those where I think it's a little misleading

657
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:42,200
that he's in the final and he's beaten Taylor Fritz,

658
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,200
Matteo Berrettini, Ben Shelton, Holger Runa.

659
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,160
It's a fantastic cast list, isn't it,

660
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,220
of players to beat to reach a final.

661
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,900
But you also have to consider the circumstances.

662
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,120
Taylor Fritz in his first match off the Lever Cup,

663
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,720
literally a day or two later,

664
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,320
I think that that probably has played a factor.

665
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,960
Matteo Berrettini actually won the first set against him

666
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,600
and then had to retire due to injury.

667
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,420
Although I did feel like Fies should have won that set.

668
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,660
I've watched all of these matches, obviously.

669
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,240
And Shelton could have beaten him as well,

670
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,920
even though I don't think that that would have been right if he had.

671
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,420
I think Fies was the better player.

672
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:23,300
He had 19 break points to just three of Shelton's.

673
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,420
So it was really close in the end, tiebreak in the third.

674
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,080
But he was the better.

675
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,180
This is the best I've seen Fies play.

676
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,140
He obviously won the Hamburg tournament.

677
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,140
That was a big deal.

678
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,400
But the first time I've seen him on a hard court

679
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,360
where his game just isn't breaking down,

680
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,380
there isn't any of the rally shots going into the net

681
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,780
or long in quite the same way as there was,

682
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,100
certainly in the first part of the year.

683
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,300
He's not missing return after return

684
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,400
the way he was for the first three months of the year.

685
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,200
There have been adjustments made, technically.

686
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,980
I'm not equipped well enough to know exactly what they are,

687
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,640
but he works with SÃ©bastien Grosjean.

688
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,500
And you can just see that the game isn't breaking down.

689
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,340
He looks solid.

690
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,780
And you add that to the natural athleticism.

691
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,200
I mean, he's got to be one of the most explosive

692
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,460
athletic specimens in tennis.

693
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:14,700
And he's also just got that chutzpah as well.

694
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,460
You know, he just wants to come and have it with you.

695
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,060
And him and Shelton, you could tell,

696
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,280
just have a real buzz about playing against each other.

697
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,380
So, no, I think this is massive.

698
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,360
But Umber has beaten him comfortably in the past

699
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,080
when they've played.

700
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,580
So, I would imagine Umber is the favourite.

701
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,020
And this is an occasion for me to roll out

702
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,540
one of my very favourite stats,

703
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,080
which is that Ugo Umber has never lost an ATP final.

704
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,080
He's six from six.

705
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:49,300
And no one has ever won their first seven.

706
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,380
The other two players to have won their first six,

707
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,740
I remember this stat from earlier in the year

708
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,240
when Umber won his sixth final.

709
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,760
The other two players are Martin Klijan and Ernest Golbis.

710
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,400
Like, it's not a list of all-time greats.

711
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,740
But Umber is looking to become the first guy

712
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,980
to win their first seven ATP finals.

713
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:16,200
And I watched him today beat the best player in the world

714
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,740
in three sets.

715
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,140
And he has an ability, Umber,

716
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,360
to suddenly lift his level

717
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:25,200
and start hitting so cleanly,

718
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,220
especially down the line.

719
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,000
He makes it seem really easy.

720
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,240
But he can reel off winners

721
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,140
kind of in a seemingly effortless way.

722
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,740
His timing is so impressive on the ball.

723
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,240
But he's got this weird thing going on, Umber.

724
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,920
Maybe it's not that weird.

725
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,680
Maybe it's quite telling about him as a player.

726
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,680
But he's playing his best tennis

727
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,140
at the least important times in the season.

728
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,280
You know, he is...

729
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,680
He's very good in that February-March period,

730
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,640
you know, where he won Marseille and Dubai

731
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,600
earlier this year.

732
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,480
And last year, in this sort of September-October-November period,

733
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,300
he won Mets.

734
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,160
Now he's in the final of Tokyo.

735
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,640
He kind of disappears over the summer,

736
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,180
like the most important time.

737
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,840
Like, he did well at Wimbledon this year.

738
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,880
He got to the fourth round and pushed Alcaraz.

739
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,060
Like, that was a good performance.

740
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,920
But he's got to start playing his best tennis

741
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,500
at the most important tournaments

742
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,720
because his top level is really good.

743
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,240
But, you know, Grand Sam's summer season,

744
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,860
he's sort of nowhere to be seen.

745
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:32,360
But, you know, it's September-October tennis again

746
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,700
and here he is lighting it up.

747
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:38,440
And, yeah, like, I think he's probably got the physical edge

748
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,480
over Feast in this final.

749
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,900
But I'm looking forward to it.

750
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,400
They're kind of in many, certainly recently,

751
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,240
finals between two French players.

752
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,120
So that'll be interesting.

753
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,280
Yeah, for sure.

754
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,460
Staying with the men over in Beijing,

755
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,560
they are at the semi-final stage.

756
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,240
The quarter-finals have been played today.

757
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,560
The last one is still on court.

758
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,180
It looks like Buwen Shaokete

759
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,360
is going to beat Andrei Robloff

760
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,260
and set up a semi-final with Yannick Senna.

761
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,120
The other semi, Daniel Medvedev,

762
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,540
who beat Flavio Caboli

763
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,240
to take on Carlos Alcaraz,

764
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,080
who's just cruised through the draw this week

765
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,500
and looks so refreshed, David.

766
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:24,900
I mean, yeah, I can't remember the last time

767
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:29,400
I saw Carlos Alcaraz look this fresh and loose.

768
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:33,500
And I include his two Grand Sam titles this season in that.

769
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,720
Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it?

770
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,580
Trying to work out what is the recipe

771
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,020
for being fresh and loose,

772
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,040
particularly, I mean, the ADB put together

773
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,480
that really great video of jet lag effects

774
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,960
and everybody looking exhausted.

775
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:49,380
And then at the end,

776
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,060
Carlos Alcaraz looking like he's just

777
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,920
having the best time

778
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,380
and he's got loads of energy.

779
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,680
It was really well put together.

780
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,640
But why did he hit the wall

781
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,940
at certain stages in the last season,

782
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:04,760
at the end of last season?

783
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:05,740
I know he was injured as well,

784
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:08,220
but he looked exhausted at the end of last season.

785
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,620
Obviously, he hit the wall

786
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,940
and was poor at the US Open.

787
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,800
Why has he suddenly got energy again?

788
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,300
Who knows?

789
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,220
You know how these things work

790
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,280
when you feel good and when you don't.

791
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,380
But goodness me,

792
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,060
when he does feel good,

793
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:23,960
you can tell.

794
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,700
You can just see it coming out of every pore

795
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,000
in his body language.

796
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,400
And when he's like that,

797
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,720
he's unstoppable, I think.

798
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,060
I mean, I just can't.

799
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,740
I can't get enough of watching it.

800
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,960
I mean, between him and Karolina Mukhera,

801
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,340
you know, just players that I would just turn on

802
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,740
to watch them perform.

803
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,200
Simple as.

804
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,760
You know, I don't care who they're playing.

805
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:49,180
And yeah, long may that continue, really.

806
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,100
I mean, and obviously,

807
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,000
because we want to see Alcaraz

808
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,160
against the other best players in the world

809
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,760
and I want to see him play Yannick Sinner.

810
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,560
And yet I still have this uneasy feeling now

811
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,660
because suddenly this case has reared its head again.

812
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,460
Very small thing on Alcaraz.

813
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,100
I didn't watch his,

814
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,340
I didn't see his match today against Hakshinov,

815
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,760
but the other ones in Beijing,

816
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,780
he hasn't had the strapping on his upper thigh,

817
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,360
which I mean, certainly all through the summer,

818
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,920
he's had that.

819
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:21,840
As you say, Catherine,

820
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,640
even when he's been winning Grand Sam titles,

821
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,320
he's been playing with that on his leg.

822
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:31,560
And yeah, like just another sign,

823
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:35,580
I think that he's freer, looser, fresher, fitter.

824
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,180
And yeah, as you say,

825
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,320
that's bad news for everyone else

826
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,360
because when Alcaraz is in that mood,

827
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,020
I mean, yeah, how do you stop him?

828
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,480
And it's still a first, isn't it?

829
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,940
We've never seen him play well

830
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,320
at this time of the season before.

831
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,900
We're still seeing first from Carlos Alcaraz,

832
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:54,460
extraordinary.

833
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:58,040
The reason presumably, Matt,

834
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,620
that you weren't watching Alcaraz against Hakshinov

835
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,400
is because you were watching Amanda Anisimova

836
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,820
continue to make Dariya Kazakina her pigeon.

837
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,020
That's 10 sets played, 10 sets won

838
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,700
by Amanda Anisimova against Dariya Kazakina.

839
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:20,920
She is through to the round of 16 in the women's

840
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,140
where she'll face Zheng Chin Wen.

841
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,360
So the men are at the semi-final stage.

842
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,380
The women are at the round of 16 stage

843
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,720
with still another week to go in Beijing.

844
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,760
Of course, for the women, it's a 1,000 event.

845
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,460
For the men, it's just a 500.

846
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,000
Quote from Matt,

847
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,540
I'm fed up of seeing Zheng Chin Wen beat my faves.

848
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,840
It's just happened a lot this summer.

849
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:44,720
What can I say?

850
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,060
Well, yeah, because it's the US Open rematch,

851
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,080
isn't it, from the first round.

852
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,680
Anisimova was cruising against Zheng Chin Wen,

853
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,620
upper set, 6-1.

854
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:00,600
What could have been had Anisimova managed to close that match?

855
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,640
But I think, you know, we've talked a lot

856
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,560
sort of privately this week about the vibes in Beijing

857
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,440
kind of missing.

858
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,320
You know, there's just,

859
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,300
you've got this enormous stadium there.

860
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,920
Like, it's vast.

861
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,720
And yet, it's pretty empty for most of these matches.

862
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,120
Apart from the Zheng Chin Wen matches,

863
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,320
they are showing up for her and filling it.

864
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,740
And it's an incredible sight to see that much support for her.

865
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:35,500
And I can imagine that she'd be much better equipped now

866
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,460
at this stage in her career to sort of embrace that support.

867
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,120
I think having won the gold medal,

868
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,920
I think she really has sort of kind of grown in stature on the court.

869
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,680
And I think it is kind of boosting her, that support.

870
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,220
And I think that's going to be a lot for Anisimova

871
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,740
to have to deal with.

872
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,860
I think that matches in a couple of days' time.

873
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:01,380
But yeah, there's some really good last 16 matches set up in Beijing.

874
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:05,240
Yeah, she is not the only Chinese woman

875
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,420
still in the draw in Beijing.

876
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:10,580
In fact, she's not even, for my money,

877
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,160
the headline Chinese woman left in the draw in Beijing.

878
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,540
Zhang Shuai, ladies and gentlemen,

879
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:21,720
is into the Beijing round of 16

880
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,400
to face Magdalena Frech later on today.

881
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:29,400
After losing 24 matches in a row,

882
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:35,360
she scored her first singles victory in 603 days,

883
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:39,080
beating McCartney Kessler 7-6-6-1.

884
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,620
And then she went on to be Emma Navarro

885
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:46,160
and Grit Minnan all in straight sets.

886
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:49,340
I feel like this is a period

887
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:57,360
that should be studied for kind of sports science PhDs,

888
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,520
like the art of...

889
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:05,660
or the unknowable mistress that is confidence and momentum

890
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:10,360
encapsulated in one human being that is Zhang Shuai.

891
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:16,040
I watched that match through gritted teeth against McCartney Kessler

892
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:21,060
just because I think I floated the idea during the US Open.

893
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,440
She might never end this run.

894
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,520
She might have to retire and not be able to end it on tour level

895
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,420
because she's going to lose a ranking eventually

896
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,000
and all this sort of thing.

897
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,360
And suddenly she's in this big tournament.

898
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:34,900
She's got the wild card.

899
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,220
And she managed to get over the line.

900
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:41,500
And you should have seen her body language when she did it

901
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:46,580
because suddenly she couldn't stop talking in the on-court interview.

902
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:49,120
And she took the mic and did her own thing.

903
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,960
It was like an audience with Zhang Shuai.

904
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,680
And it was just wonderful.

905
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,400
And then, yeah, the next thing I know,

906
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,060
I didn't bother watching the next one

907
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,260
because she's already broken the streak

908
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:01,840
and she's just kind of destroyed Emma Navarro 6462.

909
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,020
Like it's nothing.

910
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:04,740
So, yeah.

911
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,960
And the thing is, she didn't become a bad player.

912
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,900
She's always been a good player, a great backhand,

913
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,300
you know, good watch.

914
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,040
And now she's suddenly unencumbered by all this stress

915
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,060
and it's happening.

916
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:25,500
Yeah, it's so, it's just tennis, isn't it?

917
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,400
And she spoke about how everyone in the locker room

918
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,580
was so pleased for her when she got back in there.

919
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,840
They were all greeting her.

920
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:37,180
And I actually had a look at what Vincent Spadia did

921
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:41,860
after he broke his 21-match losing streak.

922
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:44,340
I thought, you know, maybe, you know,

923
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:46,880
maybe he then went on an incredible run.

924
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,460
But he did not.

925
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:53,580
He lost his very next match on grass to Albert Portas,

926
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:55,680
who was the drop shot dragon.

927
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,520
Am I right, David?

928
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:57,800
Correct.

929
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,900
I named him that.

930
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,500
That doesn't make Greg look very good, does it?

931
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,100
And then, not long after that,

932
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,740
Vincent Spadia went on an eight-match losing streak.

933
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:10,240
I sort of wonder, like, how far into that did he start thinking,

934
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,480
oh, not again?

935
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:15,480
Probably, probably three, I reckon.

936
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:15,960
Yeah.

937
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:20,560
Like, but hoping that that doesn't happen to John Schwaard.

938
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:24,900
So basically there was, there was like a sort of two and a half year period

939
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,460
where Vincent Spadia only beat Greg Rosensky.

940
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:31,160
That's about the size of it.

941
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:31,800
Yeah.

942
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,340
McCartney Kessler and Greg Rosensky beat.

943
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:35,660
Yeah, poor McCartney Kessler.

944
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,060
The Greg Rosensky comparisons.

945
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:39,660
It's not what you want.

946
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,120
Yeah.

947
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:44,660
Staying with the women's in Beijing,

948
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:48,140
Coco Goff and Naomi Osaka is happening.

949
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,380
Finally, we see them on a collision course in a draw

950
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:55,540
and it's ended up coming off.

951
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,980
Both of them playing with new coaches,

952
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,260
Naomi Osaka, of course, with Patrick Muratoglu in tow

953
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:08,780
and Coco Goff with somebody who I didn't really know,

954
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:14,740
Matt Daly has joined her coaching team.

955
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,160
She says, I'm really excited.

956
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:18,360
These quotes given to the WTA Insider.

957
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:22,260
I think this is probably what it will look like next year too.

958
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,160
I'm super excited for a new change

959
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,460
and hopefully to improve other parts of my game.

960
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,920
I think it's just time to do a reset, a refresh

961
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,580
and add things in my game that I felt like I need to do

962
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,460
to have a better season next year.

963
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:42,100
Now, I understand that he has a particular focus on grip changes.

964
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,280
Those are reports that I've read.

965
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,380
Some people speculating that she, well, actually,

966
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:52,680
I think she's kind of said that she's already made some minor adjustments

967
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,200
and she's played really well.

968
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,640
I watched her beat Katie Bolter yesterday.

969
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:00,560
Now, I do think that's, I know Bolter's beaten her once before,

970
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,840
but I do think that's a good matchup for Coco Goff,

971
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,300
provided she's playing well.

972
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:12,560
She can just make Bolter kind of have to win the point over and over and over again

973
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,660
to the point where it kind of malfunctions.

974
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,100
But I've been impressed with her this week

975
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:25,280
and Naomi Osaka is, she's playing with conviction, isn't she?

976
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:31,740
She's stepping into the court and just beasting the tennis ball

977
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:37,500
and kind of bullying opponents in the way that she used to in her heyday.

978
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:39,360
Now, it's early stages for both of them

979
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:41,620
and it could just be new manager bounce.

980
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:45,900
But I am excited for this match, David.

981
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,140
Oh, absolutely.

982
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,980
I think that they showed signs.

983
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:52,240
I mean, it's four or five years ago now, isn't it?

984
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:56,540
They showed signs of what a good rivalry they could have.

985
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:01,920
And, you know, probably at the stage of the career that Osaka's had,

986
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,200
I don't know how long she wants to play for.

987
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,020
But there's still plenty of time

988
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:11,160
and this is what could be the first installment of many.

989
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:15,680
And it is interesting seeing players who've already scaled the mountain

990
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:19,220
and for differing reasons in their two cases

991
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:23,520
are having to rebuild and come back and now clash again.

992
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,660
And it's going to be very interesting.

993
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:26,100
Yeah.

994
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:30,380
I think the most significant thing for Osaka this week

995
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:32,240
was her win over Putin's saver.

996
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,640
It was the first time she'd won a match from a set down

997
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,400
since March of 2022.

998
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,800
Now, I know she's obviously, you know, had a baby

999
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,700
and been inactive in that time.

1000
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,020
But still, it was 22 losses in a row from a set down.

1001
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,200
And I've watched a lot of Osaka matches this year.

1002
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,160
And yeah, as soon as she's lost that first set,

1003
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:59,080
there have been examples of, you know,

1004
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,680
the shoulders slumping a little bit

1005
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,400
or the game getting a bit ragged

1006
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,180
and it feeling over.

1007
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,480
And she dug in extremely well in this match,

1008
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,340
which was impressive.

1009
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:11,220
I think it's only the second time all season

1010
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,380
that she's managed to win three matches in a row.

1011
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,380
And honestly, this is kind of what I expected.

1012
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,340
You know, I thought anyway,

1013
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:22,240
like Osaka would have a chance to build during the swing

1014
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,680
where she was going to be extremely motivated

1015
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,580
at a time of year

1016
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,620
where maybe people are a little bit jaded

1017
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:29,480
on hard courts.

1018
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,320
You know, like it was all set up for her

1019
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,480
to maybe try and make some progress

1020
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,560
during this time of year.

1021
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,820
And then she brings in the new coach.

1022
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:40,140
And we've seen Muratoglu have an immediate impact

1023
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,960
with players in the past.

1024
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,520
He certainly had it with Simona Halep.

1025
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,140
He's had it with Holger Runo as well.

1026
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,200
I think we're maybe a little bit more worried

1027
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,300
about the long-term implications of that partnership.

1028
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,220
But sort of like as an initial jolt,

1029
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:58,740
I thought it probably would bring some results.

1030
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,080
And obviously, you know,

1031
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,860
Osaka's the one doing the work on the court

1032
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,740
and has played extremely impressively.

1033
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:10,940
And I really don't know which way that match is going to go

1034
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:13,620
because their matches in the past

1035
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:18,220
have been kind of one-sided for both players.

1036
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,480
They've both had one-sided wins against each other.

1037
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:24,600
I think if Goff is...

1038
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,600
If Goff is...

1039
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:28,100
I think Goff just needed a change, didn't she?

1040
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,460
She just needed a break.

1041
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,660
And it's not been enough time,

1042
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,880
even if she has made some small grip change,

1043
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,000
it's not been enough time to overhaul her entire game.

1044
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,220
Like, those vulnerabilities are still going to be there.

1045
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:42,480
But I think if she's back in her right, proper mindset

1046
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:46,200
of being able to just come through matches

1047
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,040
and compete so incredibly well,

1048
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,300
then you'd probably just give her the edge.

1049
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,600
But when Osaka's playing as well as she can,

1050
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,580
matches feel like they're on her racket as well.

1051
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,340
So, yeah, like, can't wait to watch it.

1052
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,400
We've been denied it, haven't we?

1053
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,040
We've been so close to that match so many times.

1054
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,000
We really have.

1055
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:08,840
Yeah, it's been owed by tennis.

1056
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,540
So, thank you, tennis gods.

1057
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:13,700
The Beijing WTA event is going to finish

1058
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,180
by the time we come back on Thursday,

1059
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,560
but that match will have happened.

1060
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:17,560
So, we'll talk about that,

1061
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:22,000
everything else that's happened in the Beijing WTA event

1062
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,140
and the men's events in Beijing and Tokyo,

1063
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:28,140
which will have finished by that point.

1064
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,180
So, we'll be back on Thursday.

1065
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:34,600
Before then, we have our rescheduled live show

1066
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,880
for friends this Wednesday night.

1067
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,340
We had to postpone last week due to illness.

1068
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,000
Matt is now back to full fitness.

1069
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:46,400
I'm looking at his refreshed face now

1070
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,540
and can confirm we're all ready

1071
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,360
and raring to go for Wednesday night.

1072
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:55,940
It is a Q&A show with questions from the barge

1073
01:13:55,940 --> 01:14:00,760
about coaching, which feels extremely pertinent just now.

1074
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,320
We've had some brilliant questions in

1075
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,880
and a minor spoiler alert here.

1076
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,120
David has been dialing a Dan.

1077
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,960
So, that's going to be a great show.

1078
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,500
And a Delgado.

1079
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,640
A Dan and a Delgado

1080
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,060
and I'm sure there'll be some Pam as well.

1081
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,980
So, people have been dialed

1082
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:22,680
and some of them rhyme with Dan.

1083
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:29,600
So, if you'd like to join us for that show,

1084
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,480
either live or as a podcast,

1085
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,920
then become a friend if you aren't already.

1086
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:37,480
And as I say, the link to do that is in our show notes.

1087
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,320
We have a mascot for this episode

1088
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,460
and frankly, everything up until this point

1089
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:46,040
has just been padding for me to get to Arrow.

1090
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:46,240
Arrow.

1091
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:49,980
I've already sent a picture of Arrow to my mum this morning

1092
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,860
when I was going through the agenda.

1093
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:56,460
Arrow is honestly ridiculous.

1094
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,480
Probably, and Billie Jean is within it,

1095
01:14:59,560 --> 01:14:59,720
in short,

1096
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:02,520
probably one of the most beautiful dogs I've ever seen.

1097
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,000
Elizabeth is Arrow's owner

1098
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,140
and Elizabeth writes,

1099
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,560
Arrow is my sister.

1100
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:11,800
Oh no, so Elizabeth isn't Arrow's owner.

1101
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:14,160
Arrow is my sister and dog,

1102
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,060
aka my new niece.

1103
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:18,180
Arrow was adopted in 2023

1104
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,000
and is named after one of Anne's favourite

1105
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,400
Harry Nielsen songs.

1106
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,680
Arrow likes hiking,

1107
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,060
wrestling with other dogs,

1108
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,280
eating butter off her Grammy's kitchen table

1109
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,220
and napping on the coldest bathroom tiles she can find.

1110
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,180
She doesn't know much about the rules of tennis

1111
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,000
but enjoys the balls immensely.

1112
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,600
Now, Elizabeth doesn't tell us what breed Arrow is.

1113
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,800
I think that's an Australian shepherd.

1114
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,900
But I will put a picture of Arrow on our Instagram

1115
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:48,080
and I invite your feedback on that.

1116
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,880
And Elizabeth, please let us know.

1117
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:54,060
I feel quite confident that's an Australian shepherd

1118
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,200
but I'm so dazzled by his beauty

1119
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,620
that I could be wrong.

1120
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,320
He's looking,

1121
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,980
he's staring into my soul.

1122
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,860
I'm losing concentration.

1123
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,700
So thank you, Elizabeth.

1124
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:06,820
And thank you, Arrow.

1125
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:10,400
Hello to our mascots,

1126
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,160
the dearly departed Darwin,

1127
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:14,720
Francis and Haida and Soma.

1128
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,320
Hello to Billie Jean King and Alana Kloss

1129
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,820
who, of course, are sponsors of Billie Jean Canine.

1130
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,840
Hello to our top folks and executive producers,

1131
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:25,060
Chris, Greg, Jamie and Jeff.

1132
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,560
And Matt, we have some shout-outs.

1133
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:31,160
We have Deborah Bloom.

1134
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:35,260
Hello, Deborah.

1135
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:36,500
Hello, Deborah.

1136
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:39,020
Like Gilad Bloom.

1137
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:41,780
Yes.

1138
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,220
Yes, a player that we were both on the Champions Tour with briefly.

1139
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:47,980
Yeah, that's right.

1140
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,320
Briefly.

1141
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:49,560
Yes.

1142
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:53,480
I knew Gilad Bloom

1143
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:57,020
because there was a Champions Tour event in Sao Paulo

1144
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:00,080
that was held at a tennis club

1145
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,940
in the Jewish quarter of Sao Paulo

1146
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:06,440
and the organisers of the tennis club

1147
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:09,900
wanted a Jewish player to compete

1148
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,740
and Gilad Bloom was available.

1149
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,480
And I played football against Gilad

1150
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,600
in the Maradona match, would you believe?

1151
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,660
And I've just fact-checked this

1152
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:23,380
by looking above my TV

1153
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:26,620
where the two teams are intermingled

1154
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:29,020
and there is Thomas Muster,

1155
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,580
there is Goran Ivenicevic,

1156
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,860
there is Diego Maradona,

1157
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:38,260
Davos Shuka, Gilad Bloom and me

1158
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,220
and Boris Becker as referee.

1159
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:44,200
So it's between you and Gilad Bloom

1160
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,840
for least famous.

1161
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:46,960
Yes.

1162
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,660
I will take a photo of the photo for you.

1163
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,340
How about that?

1164
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,160
What do we know about Deborah?

1165
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,440
Deborah is from Indiana.

1166
01:17:59,380 --> 01:17:59,900
Oh.

1167
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:01,800
And she's on the barge.

1168
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:05,540
I think the capital of Indiana is Springfield.

1169
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,240
No, Springfield, Illinois.

1170
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:08,460
Capital of Indiana.

1171
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,100
What else do we know?

1172
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:13,940
Indiana.

1173
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:14,140
Indiana.

1174
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,100
Well, Deborah is from a place called

1175
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:21,440
Goshen?

1176
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,180
Goshen?

1177
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,120
I'm not quite sure how to pronounce that.

1178
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,480
Like Deborah Jevons,

1179
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:29,820
the chair of the All England Tennis Club.

1180
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,120
Very good.

1181
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:32,140
Very good.

1182
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:33,840
Indianapolis, of course,

1183
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,700
is the capital of Indiana.

1184
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:36,920
I was going to say that

1185
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:37,280
and I thought,

1186
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,280
isn't that too obvious?

1187
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:41,380
Sigh.

1188
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,220
Deborah, thank you.

1189
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,980
I enjoyed that shout out very much.

1190
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,820
We've also got James Lynn,

1191
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,960
who is from Rye, New York.

1192
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,380
Hi, James.

1193
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:56,440
Hello, James.

1194
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,000
Presumably New York State

1195
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,780
rather than New York City.

1196
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,480
Yes.

1197
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,060
Um, yeah.

1198
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,340
Um, James.

1199
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,880
Well, James would like to dedicate

1200
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,480
his shout out to his 95-year-old

1201
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,480
great uncle, Ken Yang,

1202
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:18,440
who helped raise him

1203
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,080
and introduced him to tennis.

1204
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,500
Oh, that's magnificent.

1205
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:25,280
Hello, Ken.

1206
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,500
Uh, like Ken Rosewall.

1207
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:28,300
What a brilliant

1208
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,900
tennis name.

1209
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:32,440
What a brilliant sort of

1210
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,520
elder statesman

1211
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,680
of tennis name

1212
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,780
Ken is.

1213
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,900
That is lovely, James.

1214
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,640
Hello to you

1215
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,620
and hello to

1216
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,280
Ken.

1217
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,380
And James says

1218
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:43,560
he appreciates the podcast

1219
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,780
because we're sports

1220
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,640
podcasters

1221
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,300
who do not

1222
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,340
yell and scream

1223
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:48,040
at each other.

1224
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,580
Maybe we should start?

1225
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:55,600
Well, that's what our mate Dave

1226
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,820
wants us to do more of,

1227
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,220
isn't it?

1228
01:19:59,380 --> 01:19:59,800
Yeah.

1229
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:00,940
We'll certainly disagree

1230
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,220
but maybe not yell and scream.

1231
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:02,480
Yeah.

1232
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:04,400
No, I'm not sure we'll ever.

1233
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,100
We're too...

1234
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,560
We're not yell and screamy people.

1235
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,160
We're conflict-avoidant Brits,

1236
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:08,860
James.

1237
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:10,520
That's not really our vibe.

1238
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,580
Thank you, James.

1239
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:14,540
And finally,

1240
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:16,840
we have Andy Brown

1241
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,280
in Orpington, London

1242
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,640
but grew up in Reading.

1243
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:23,260
Hey!

1244
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,560
Is Andy a Reading fan?

1245
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:26,380
Andy says...

1246
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:27,680
Is he in the depths of despair?

1247
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:28,520
Andy says,

1248
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,080
Catherine will sympathise

1249
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,300
as I'm a long-standing

1250
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:31,940
Reading fan.

1251
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,380
You got a win

1252
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:33,840
at the weekend,

1253
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:34,220
didn't you?

1254
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:35,120
Yeah.

1255
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,220
Yeah, we did.

1256
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:37,560
Yeah.

1257
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:40,220
Doesn't mean much

1258
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,220
if you cease to exist

1259
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:41,980
but yeah.

1260
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:43,500
And Andy

1261
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,260
like Andy Murray

1262
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:44,920
and Andy Roddick

1263
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,120
so it's all coming up Andy.

1264
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:48,680
And Andy Carroll

1265
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,380
briefly played for Reading.

1266
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:52,940
Now playing somewhere

1267
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:53,600
in France,

1268
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:54,140
I think.

1269
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:55,440
Andy Carroll

1270
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,240
when he played for Reading

1271
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,160
scored

1272
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,100
I think the best goal

1273
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,440
to ever be disallowed.

1274
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,540
It was against Fulham.

1275
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:03,240
Oh yes,

1276
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:03,780
I agree.

1277
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,100
You know that Andy Carroll

1278
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,560
is still thinking about that

1279
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,460
every night.

1280
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,180
That's why he keeps still playing.

1281
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:09,980
He's trying to

1282
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:10,700
one-up it.

1283
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,360
He was a good man

1284
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:13,940
for us.

1285
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:15,360
He paid

1286
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,420
he played for not very much

1287
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:18,400
to, I mean,

1288
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:18,700
you know,

1289
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,260
for selfish reasons

1290
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:20,820
but he,

1291
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:21,380
you know,

1292
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,780
he did us a favour

1293
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:25,760
in a dark time

1294
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,520
and we are still

1295
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,460
in that dark time.

1296
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:27,860
Andy,

1297
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:28,460
you have

1298
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:30,420
my deepest

1299
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,820
sympathies

1300
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:32,360
and

1301
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,980
yeah,

1302
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,060
we're in this together.

1303
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:36,360
So,

1304
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,840
thank you very much.

1305
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:38,680
Thank you to all of us.

1306
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:39,640
Shout out friends,

1307
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:40,440
our intro friends,

1308
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:41,520
our friends of the Tennis Podcast.

1309
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,540
We will see

1310
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:43,720
lots of you

1311
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,480
on Wednesday,

1312
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:45,080
I hope,

1313
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,580
8pm UK time.

1314
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:47,600
We'll be live on YouTube

1315
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,280
with that coaching show.

1316
