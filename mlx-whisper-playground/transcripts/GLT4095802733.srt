Hello and welcome to The Rest is Money with me, Steph McGovern.

16
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,960
And with me, Robert Peston.

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:09,280
Now, everybody at the moment is saying we're all too gloomy, especially the government, about the state of the economy, about the state of the country.

18
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:18,100
Today, therefore, we're going to be looking at a branch of economics called the economics of happiness, aren't we, Steph?

19
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:28,680
Yeah, because we have got Professor Happiness himself with us, Lord Richard Layard, who is, he's dedicated his life to research in the economics of well-being.

20
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,600
He's the founder of the Centre for Economic Performance, the co-director of LSE's Community Well-Being Programme.

21
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,660
And he's been really influential in public policy for decades now, particularly in the Brown Blair era.

22
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:53,020
Now, with a government that's so obsessed with generating growth, one of the things we're going to look at is actually whether faster-growing economies actually make people happier.

23
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,960
Or whether actually, in some cases, people are more miserable in fast-growing economies.

24
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:07,620
And actually, the other thing which I'm quite interested in is whether it's even coherent to measure happiness in a sort of scientific way.

25
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:17,860
And we'll also look at why young people in rich countries like the US and the UK seem now, this is what the surveys show, to be less happy than those over 60.

26
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,780
And that wasn't always the case and actually isn't true in other countries.

27
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,760
So, lots to dig into, isn't there?

28
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,560
Yeah. So, here's our interview with Lord Richard Layard.

29
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:36,180
I am so excited to talk to you because I love the idea of happiness being the goal we should all achieve in life.

30
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,120
Because that's what I always think about. I always think, what do I care most about? It's being happy and healthy.

31
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,620
So, can you just define, first of all, what you mean when you're talking about happiness and well-being?

32
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,500
Well, it's how people feel about their lives. Are they satisfied? Do they feel fulfilled?

33
00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:00,480
And this is surely what we most want, a society where people have that experience of life, the quality of life, if you like.

34
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:08,740
And the great thing is, I mean, this is a great idea going back to the 18th century, that this is how we should define the good society.

35
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,820
But until recently, we couldn't measure it.

36
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,700
And therefore, it was more difficult to think about how to achieve that objective.

37
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:27,300
And the great thing that psychologists have done for us in the last 40 years is found that you can ask perfectly sensible questions like, overall, how satisfied are you with your life these days?

38
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,220
0 to 10, 0, not at all 10 very.

39
00:04:30,220 --> 00:05:00,220
0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10, 0

40
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:09,020
Yes, it's not just morally right to try and promote a society where people are enjoying their lives, but that is actually the best way to get re-elected.

41
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:29,660
Now, you've been talking about this for years. You set up a department at the London School of Economics dedicated to research in this area. But my very clear impression is that sometimes you've been sort of banging your head against a brick wall when it comes to persuading politicians, political leaders to do more than pay lip service.

42
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:40,120
I mean, yes, Downing Street sort of started to supposedly to take this stuff seriously. But in practice, have you seen genuine policies flow from this?

43
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:59,120
Well, I think you could say that the increased interest in mental health is partly affected by this movement, that the people are saying what we want is a better experience of life. And one of the ways in which people are most not getting that experience is because of mental illness.

44
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:10,200
But we know that we have appalling mental health provision in this country. Again, the last government talked about putting more resource in, but even so, wholly inadequate provision of mental health resource.

45
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:27,180
It's still wholly inadequate, but it's incredibly much better than it was 20 years ago. So that's one thing I would say. But what we've got, going back to your question, is international organizations increasingly saying this is the objective and this is what we want member countries to be pursuing.

46
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:42,460
And the great thing is that Keir Starmer has said that when elected, Labour will require the Treasury to evaluate all spending proposals in terms of their impact on wellbeing and not just on GDP.

47
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:52,420
So I think we are now poised for a big advance in the systematic use of wellbeing as the measure of the success of our country.

48
00:06:52,420 --> 00:07:04,660
Do you know what? I was really interested in something you said, which was to do with how closely connected to improved happiness is the increased influence of women in our society.

49
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:14,660
And you cite the former female leaders of Scotland, of Iceland, of Iceland, who all put happiness as a policy, didn't they?

50
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:27,760
They have done. And I think that's no accident because obviously the evidence is that women tend to be more concerned with feelings and how people are experiencing life.

51
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:34,620
Men tend to be more concerned with, quote, objective indicators. So I think that that's no accident.

52
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:45,140
And of course, it is the influence of women which has also brought about this much greater psychological awareness in the population, including the population of men.

53
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,520
And that is also what has been leading to more but not adequate attention to mental health.

54
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,020
So do you think now having a female chancellor, it will make the country happier?

55
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,080
Do you think because there will be, you know, extra feelings there?

56
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,320
Well, we've fortunately got a lot of good female ministers.

57
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,060
Yeah, we have.

58
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,240
So yes, I'm certainly hoping that's going to be the case.

59
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,080
We've had a couple of female prime ministers. The most famous was Margaret Thatcher.

60
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,920
Was the country happier under Margaret Thatcher?

61
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,200
No, some people wouldn't say she was very female.

62
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:33,700
Well, I think the really important moment that's coming up in Britain is the spending review because, you know, the government spends nearly half of the whole national income.

63
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,500
What should it be trying to do with that?

64
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,720
It should be trying to improve the well-being of the people.

65
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,960
That's actually Thomas Jefferson said that's the only legitimate objective of government.

66
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:50,680
And I completely agree with him. Why do we have government if it isn't to improve our well-being and to make sure it's better spread?

67
00:08:51,300 --> 00:09:04,440
So in the spending review that's coming up, going to be announced in March next year, we are pushing for all policies to be, as Keir Starmer promised, evaluated in terms of their impact on well-being.

68
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:14,220
Just explain to listeners, how would they, in practice, evaluate those policies in respect of whether or not they make people happier?

69
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,440
Yes, this has to be done, of course, in a quantitative way.

70
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,400
If you're going to compare the strength of one policy with another.

71
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:30,720
How would you determine whether building a road makes people better off in the broadest sense of happiness compared to some other bit of investment?

72
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,940
Yeah, so you measure the benefits and you compare them with the costs.

73
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,700
Do you ask people locally and then, I mean, how do you do it?

74
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:47,280
No, you have evidence, say on a road program, of how much it's going to reduce the time and hassle of journeys.

75
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,720
And then you have measures of how that affects people's well-being.

76
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,540
Or their stress, for example.

77
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,700
Yes, and that can be then converted into the monetary equivalent.

78
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,060
And then you look at the ratio of the benefit to the cost.

79
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:15,660
So well-being does, in a way, always, if you're going to take it seriously in a quantitative way, you do convert the well-being into pound sterling, do you?

80
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,600
You monetize it.

81
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:24,000
That's the way the Treasury so-called Green Book, which is the manual that departments are meant to follow when they make their bids for money.

82
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,400
That's what it says.

83
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,700
Do you think that's the right approach, though?

84
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,360
Because when I've talked to you in the past, you've been rather critical of putting a monetary value on things like this.

85
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:33,820
No.

86
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:46,960
Provided you're measuring the well-being correctly, obviously you can then look at the benefits relative to the cost, either in units of well-being or just multiply them all by a number to turn them into money, which is how the Treasury wants it done.

87
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,700
And that's how we've done in this report we've recently published, which we hope will affect how the spending review is done.

88
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:07,220
So going back to your question, one can look at every policy, and we looked at about 20 policies in our report, to see what difference do they make to well-being and how does that compare with the cost?

89
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:15,800
Because the objective, obviously, if you want to get value for money, is to choose those policies that have the highest well-being per pound of cost.

90
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,200
It's not just the initial cost, of course.

91
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,960
It also has to be reduced for whatever cost savings it then produces.

92
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:31,600
So we come out with mental health as the best value for money of the things we looked at because it helps people back into work.

93
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,320
That helps to make their lives better.

94
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,560
That's the benefit side.

95
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,340
It also helps the exchequer because it means that they're paying taxes and coming off benefits.

96
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,340
So that should be the number one priority.

97
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,240
So I think this is the absolute no-brainer.

98
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:58,440
I've been involved with something called NHS Talking Therapies, which is now being used to treat 750,000 people a year, 50% of them recovery during the course of treatment.

99
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,820
We are also trying to get other categories of mental illness much better treated.

100
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:17,200
So, for example, nice recommend that everybody with an addiction to alcohol, drugs or gambling should be provided with the right psychological therapy.

101
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,480
About 5% get it, if that, at the moment.

102
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:30,980
So we're wanting to have a new parallel service for addictions set up within the NHS during the spending review.

103
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:39,340
Aren't there a lot of things like problems with addiction and things like that and other mental health problems a result of things that have happened much earlier in their lives?

104
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:50,160
And so isn't there a case for perhaps if we spend more money on early intervention in childhood, if we spend more money on education around, you know, helping people get into work and things like that?

105
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:58,320
Do you think then we wouldn't have as many mental health problems and maybe we need to go back right to the beginning rather than just pumping money into that?

106
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,760
So treat the cause rather than the symptoms?

107
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,080
Yeah.

108
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,600
Well, it shouldn't be rather than.

109
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,120
It should be both, shouldn't it?

110
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,760
I mean, if there are people out there suffering, my own view is that the moral imperative is to help the people who are suffering.

111
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,240
But obviously, we should also be trying to prevent the suffering in the first place.

112
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:24,580
So one of the policies which we evaluate is something which I feel very strongly about, which is the teaching of life skills in schools.

113
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:47,580
So we piloted a curriculum one hour a week from age 11 to age 15 of the basic skills, social and emotional learning, obviously the standard subjects there, but also coping with media, media awareness, understanding mental illness, practice of mindfulness, what it's going to be like to be a parent.

114
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,700
A whole range of things, very evidence-based, very manualized.

115
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:02,100
We then evaluate it and we find that it has a big increase in well-being for the children who experienced it compared with the control group.

116
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,400
This is an important point, that this has got to be done very professionally.

117
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,060
The teachers have got to be trained.

118
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:14,800
There were, from the previous Labour government, heroic efforts to improve well-being of children.

119
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,600
And they were shown in the experiment to have had no effect at all.

120
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,600
Good intentions are not enough.

121
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,200
This has got to be done very, very professionally.

122
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:35,460
Yeah, it's really interesting because we were talking to Youth Employment UK, the social enterprise, which looks at why young people are suffering perhaps more than other generations and what's going on in their world.

123
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:45,860
And one of the things that came out was this recurring theme of they feel like they're always in competition, whether it's getting services, whether it's getting a home, whether it's getting a job.

124
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,680
And that is the thing that is kind of, I guess, stifling their happiness.

125
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,600
I think there are two things going on.

126
00:14:51,680 --> 00:15:01,320
I mean, one is the increase in competition, partly the very idea that your purpose in life is to be more successful than other people.

127
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,200
This has spread like a cancer from America spreading around the world.

128
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,960
This is doing a lot to reduce happiness.

129
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:20,000
I think the issues of measurement that people like me are responsible for, league tables, all of that sort of thing, has added to the tension that's generated.

130
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:28,580
Because rather than competition being something that just happens in the background, it now is happening all the time in the foreground.

131
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,620
But I think the other awful thing is the way social media operates.

132
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,060
I mean, we were brought up not to show off.

133
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:45,680
Social media are explicitly designed to enable people to show off the good features of their lives.

134
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,440
And that has the effect of making other people miserable.

135
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:54,920
Now, we know this from proper controlled experiments where people have stopped using Facebook and become happier.

136
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:07,440
So I think it is clear that our children have got to be educated in a way that makes them much more sensible in relation to social media,

137
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:15,280
either not using them or using them in a quite different spirit than to see who's got the best holiday or whatever it is.

138
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:30,060
And do you think social media, the pernicious impact of it, is the main reason why we've seen this shift such that older people in the UK and the US are now happier than younger people,

139
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,740
which was certainly not always the case and is not the case in many other countries?

140
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,320
I think it's a convincing case.

141
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,800
Jonathan Haidt has made this in his book.

142
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:48,200
The timing is so very precise that the measures of depression in childhood or I don't feel my life is worthwhile, I feel left out.

143
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:57,280
I mean, these start shooting up from 2010 onwards, which is exactly the time when the social media participation shot up.

144
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,680
So I think it is a pretty persuasive argument, though I think the controlled trials are, in a way, even more persuasive.

145
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:12,540
So I would agree with you that that is probably the biggest thing in the last 15 years or so.

146
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:20,240
But I think that what you mentioned earlier about competition is also a background factor that's at work.

147
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:35,240
Now, you'll have noticed that Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, has just announced that it is imposing much more restrictions on what young people can do on Instagram.

148
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:46,240
There's now going to be special young persons Instagram accounts, which will mean that, in theory at least, young people will have lesser access to some of the more pernicious stuff.

149
00:17:46,240 --> 00:18:05,680
I suppose the question for me is, do you think that governments, though, need to take more of a role in, in a sense, compelling the big digital giants to reform such that some of the harm that's being done to young people is reduced?

150
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,240
Can we trust the giants to make these voluntary gestures?

151
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,380
Because this is something that Meta has just decided to do.

152
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,920
We don't know whether it's going to work yet.

153
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,140
It is striking to me that governments are slow to get involved and regulate.

154
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,080
Well, I think that's always happened with any innovation, hasn't it?

155
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,720
In 1930, the number of people killed on Britain's roads was 7,000.

156
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,260
There was hardly any regulation.

157
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,040
Since then, we've regulated the roads, the driver, the car, everything.

158
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,960
And the number of deaths is around 2,000.

159
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,900
This will happen, undoubtedly, in the same way with social media.

160
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,420
It takes too long.

161
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,780
Lives are ruined in the process.

162
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,320
It is.

163
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:54,540
I mean, the most obvious things are to raise the age when people can have a social media account and have proper age verification.

164
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,760
So Jonathan Hight says 16.

165
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,820
I think, again, it's much more difficult for one school to do it on its own.

166
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,440
I think the government should simply ban phones in schools.

167
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,720
I'm a parent of a soon-to-be five-year-old who's just gone in to start school this month.

168
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:19,520
And already all the parents are talking about devices and whether there's a way of us all making a decision to leave it as long as possible.

169
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,100
Obviously, if she's not getting one at five, she's not going to have a phone at five.

170
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,040
But at which point do you allow them to have a device so they're not being left out?

171
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,800
Because if a child feels like they're being left out, that can cause concerns for them.

172
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,440
That can affect their own mental health.

173
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,880
But equally, you don't want them to be part of it.

174
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,460
It's really difficult, isn't it, to try and stop having them?

175
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,020
You've just made the basic point.

176
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,760
This is a collective action problem.

177
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,460
If everybody is in the same position, nobody feels left out.

178
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,940
So that's why we need collective action by governments.

179
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,320
Yeah.

180
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,540
Lots still to talk to you about, but let's have a quick break.

181
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:10,440
I wanted to look at how much of what determines well-being and happiness are really quite long-standing cultural factors,

182
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,560
which are hard to shift.

183
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:21,040
So the countries that are happiest in the league tables that are produced hold those positions year after year after year,

184
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:27,880
which does slightly suggest to me that it's very hard for governments to make a difference.

185
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,300
So talk to us about which countries have historically been happier and what we can learn from them.

186
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,520
Well, we actually only have really reliable comparable measures from about 2005.

187
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,880
It's still 20 years.

188
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,980
That's a 20-year period.

189
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,960
And in that period, the Scandinavian countries are always up at the top, together with Netherlands, Switzerland.

190
00:20:50,960 --> 00:21:00,080
So I think it's obvious that these are countries, especially Scandinavian countries, which are more egalitarian in their outlook,

191
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:09,260
where children are told that their job is to contribute to the social good and to feel that other children are equal with them.

192
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,720
That's a sense of community, is it?

193
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,200
It's the sense of community that matters.

194
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:20,580
Rather than the Anglo-Saxon model, where increasingly children are told your job is to be different and better than other children.

195
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,260
That's a terrible message to be sending to people.

196
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:33,280
So in spite of affluence, Britain and the United States are around 15 or lower in the order of countries.

197
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:41,040
Now then, other countries, if you go to the bottom end, are very much affected by things which do actually vary from year to year, like conflict.

198
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,300
So conflict is the worst thing.

199
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,260
I mean, I'll just give you some numbers, actually.

200
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,640
I mean, the Scandinavian countries are like 7.5 to 8 on the scale of 0 to 10.

201
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,980
Afghanistan is 2.9.

202
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,140
I mean, and the other countries with conflict are right down at the bottom there.

203
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,420
And of course, it does vary with the degree of conflict.

204
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,040
So it's not true that nothing changes.

205
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:13,020
But can I just look at countries which we think of as being more stable, more free from that kind of appalling, violent conflict?

206
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:21,580
So if you compare countries where if you just looked at GDP per head, the differences aren't that great, the average.

207
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,840
So US, one of the richest countries in the world on GDP per head.

208
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,300
We don't do too badly on GDP per head, not nearly as rich as America, but still pretty rich.

209
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:53,500
Is it, in your view, very easy to say and correct to say that it is the greater inequality in Britain and America than in a Scandinavian country, for example, that is directly related to why in Scandinavia they feel happier?

210
00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:01,000
To what extent do white inequalities contribute to a lower sense of general well-being?

211
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:11,820
Well, I mean, the first point about income is, of course, the very old proposition that as you get richer, an extra pound makes less and less difference to your well-being.

212
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,140
I mean, that's what they believed in the 18th century.

213
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,080
And now, of course, we can show it empirically.

214
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:23,080
So that means that, you know, for a given average income, you'll have more happiness if it's more equally distributed.

215
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:29,680
So that's broadly just a simple point that poorer people become very, very much happier if you manage to lift them up.

216
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:40,480
Exactly. But on top of that, I think the ethos of equality is actually more important than the specific detail of the distribution of income.

217
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,160
What do you mean by that?

218
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:50,320
What I was saying before about the Scandinavian countries, what are the norms, what are the attitudes that you have with respect to your fellow citizens?

219
00:23:50,740 --> 00:24:00,120
If you feel that you fundamentally want to concentrate on things you have in common, you will have a happier society than if people are trying to show up how different they are.

220
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,060
So it's less competitive.

221
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,620
Yes.

222
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:11,600
Yeah. Something you mentioned as well, which I found fascinating, and you said, I read it in one of your books, the least happy time for people at work is when they are with their boss.

223
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:11,920
Yeah.

224
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,040
So what's going on there? Is that to do a competition?

225
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:22,520
Well, that's terrible, obviously, isn't it? And I think this is partly connected with the philosophy of management, which is drive them as hard as you possibly can.

226
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:32,440
Get every inch out of your workers that you can, rather than think that your workers will perform best if they are getting some satisfaction out of what they're doing.

227
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:44,260
And that is actually a good lesson for productivity, but it's also obviously very important for people's well-being in their lives because work is such a big part of people's lives.

228
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:56,680
So I think that we need a massive movement in management schools and elsewhere to promote and understand what really makes people feel flourishing at work.

229
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:07,400
And we will find, actually, because this is what the evidence shows, that this will not only make people happier, which is the main thing, but also improve their productivity.

230
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,880
Yeah, which is what we have a huge problem with in this country.

231
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:28,640
Can I just ask on this, I think, absolutely fascinating issue about the difference between what you might call a collective competitive desire, you know, a whole community wanting to succeed as a community, perhaps a whole country wanting to succeed as a country,

232
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:44,380
versus that grass is always greener, you know, personal competition thing, which you believe to an extent undermines the well-being, the sense of well-being and happiness in a country like the UK or the US.

233
00:25:44,380 --> 00:26:00,000
Is there evidence, because I feel that anecdotally there is, that there are generational differences now in attitudes of this sort between younger people in a country like the UK and older people.

234
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:13,020
So I think it is arguable that my generation has instinctively felt more comfortable with this kind of personal competition, but so-called Gen Z and Gen Alpha don't like it.

235
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,520
And they would much rather have a more collective approach.

236
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,020
Do you get a sense of that?

237
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,740
I haven't seen such evidence.

238
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:30,160
I mean, I've seen evidence from the States, which shows that a couple of questions asked of students, how important is it to you to feel you're contributing to the common good?

239
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,300
How important is it to you to be rich?

240
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,100
And the desire to contribute has fallen.

241
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,020
The desire to be rich has risen.

242
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,480
In America?

243
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,680
Pretty much steadily.

244
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,200
And do you think that would be true in this country too?

245
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,620
I haven't seen evidence.

246
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,580
I'm an economist.

247
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:54,380
I've been quite disappointed in the lack of time series produced by sociologists of what people are trying to do in their lives.

248
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,160
What are their fundamental norms?

249
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,200
I mean, this has seemed to me pretty much the most important question in sociology.

250
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,020
And I would love to see that evidence, but I've looked around and I haven't found it.

251
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,520
But maybe somebody who hears this podcast will send me some.

252
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,200
But I think that this is a very, very central question.

253
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:31,680
In this issue of changing attitudes so that you get more of a sense of collective mission, which maybe makes people feel a bit happier, where would you look to the kind of political leadership as opposed to somehow inherited cultural historical factors?

254
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,800
Where would you look to the kind of political leadership that's actually pulled that off?

255
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:41,760
Well, I think that the phraseology of politicians does affect the atmosphere in the country.

256
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,420
We talked about Margaret Thatcher.

257
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,940
I think she produced a much more acerbic atmosphere in the country.

258
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,580
I think Tony Blair produced a more congenial atmosphere in the country.

259
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:57,300
I think that George Osborne produced a more conflictual atmosphere in the country.

260
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:07,460
And I'm very much hoping that Keir Starmer, and you can only see from what he says, that this is actually what he most cares about, to change the fundamental atmosphere in the country.

261
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,400
So I'm really hoping that that will happen.

262
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,820
But I just wanted to make one other point about competition.

263
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,960
The competition has a very, very important role in society.

264
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,200
But it's competition between organizations.

265
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,080
We do want competition between organizations.

266
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,700
We don't want monopolies, where people just rest on their laurels.

267
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,300
We want them to be on their toes.

268
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:36,120
And we should always distinguish between organizations and competition between individuals within organizations.

269
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,840
That's the unhealthy thing.

270
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:44,120
But that was my point about how do you foster that collective effort, that sense of identity with an institution.

271
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:50,220
One of the things people most enjoy is team spirit, obviously in sports, but also at work.

272
00:28:50,660 --> 00:29:04,680
And it's been shown that when people are rewarded, not on the basis of this horrible individual performance pay with forced rankings, but paid on the basis of the performance of the team, they are not only happier, but they are more productive.

273
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,980
There is, of course, rather a dangerous fine line.

274
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:21,440
Because particularly when a country is in trouble, you know, you get proto-fascism or real fascism, essentially manufacturing a toxic sense of collective national endeavor that is very dangerous.

275
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,700
No, of course, that's horrible.

276
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,980
I mean, nationalism is unpleasant.

277
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,300
Pride in your country is good.

278
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,740
But the feeling that your country has got to be on top of other countries is a terrible feeling.

279
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:41,180
And what we do know from well-being research is that unhappy people vote for populist candidates.

280
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:47,660
So one very important reason to have a happier population is to avoid that kind of populism.

281
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,020
Yeah.

282
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,480
And that's exactly why lots of people voted for Brexit in the North East, because they were really not happy with what was going on.

283
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,980
Are you happy?

284
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,900
Most of the time.

285
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,100
Of course, one goes up and down, all of us.

286
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,480
Yeah.

287
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,660
I think I'm blessed with a reasonably happy disposition.

288
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,060
Yeah.

289
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:11,620
And I think as well, you know, we don't normally talk about ages on the show, but given you're 90, I think you're a prime evidence of focusing on happiness.

290
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,320
Does make you live longer, do you think?

291
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,120
I don't know.

292
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,680
I think my wife makes me live longer and tennis makes me live longer.

293
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:26,200
I have learned a bit since I got into this field about 25 years ago.

294
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:33,200
I think there are some basic truths about managing your mental life and so on, which everybody needs to learn.

295
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:41,340
A few of which I've learned more recently through contacts with great people like the Dalai Lama, Thich Nhat Hanh and so on.

296
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,120
And I think they've got a great message for us.

297
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,360
Yeah.

298
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:43,700
Yeah.

299
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,200
Fascinating.

300
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,840
Well, thank you so much for your time.

301
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,680
My pleasure.

302
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,280
I've been smiling the whole way through it, which is lovely.

303
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:57,160
Well, look, it's great to have for once, you know, an optimistic message about how we create a better society.

304
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:57,740
Yeah.

305
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,080
I love it.

306
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,920
Thank you very much.

307
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,540
No pleasure.

308
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,480
That's it from us.

309
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:00,860
Bye bye.

310
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:01,600
All the best.

311
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:01,840
Goodbye.

312
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:01,940
Goodbye.

313
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,940
Bye bye.
