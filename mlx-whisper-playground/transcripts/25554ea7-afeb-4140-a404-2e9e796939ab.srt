00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
Welcome to the Tech Meme Ride Home for Monday, September 30th, 2024. I'm Brian McCullough. Today,

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,940
that controversial AI bill in California has been vetoed by Governor Newsom.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:19,640
Is even Apple now thinking that its Vision Pro strategy might need a rethink? What really is

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,280
OpenAI's situation right now, and this time I'm talking money-wise, and the strange resurrection

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,240
of the point-and-shoot camera? Here's what you missed today in the world of tech.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,740
California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed AI Safety Bill SB 1047, saying it applies only to

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:46,320
large AI models and doesn't account for if deployment is high risk. This was that AI bill

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,420
that a lot of the AI community and AI VCs were very worried about, quoting the journal.

9
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,060
California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a controversial artificial intelligence safety

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,880
bill that pitted some of the biggest tech companies against prominent scientists who developed the

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,560
technology. The Democrat decided to reject the measure because it applies only to the biggest

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,920
and most expensive AI models and doesn't take into account whether they are deployed in high-risk

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,620
situations, he said in his veto message. Smaller models sometimes handle critical decision-making

14
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:21,200
involving sensitive data such as electrical grids and medical records, while bigger models at times

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,040
handle low-risk activities such as customer service. Had Newsom signed the bill into law, it would have

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,280
laid the groundwork for how AI is regulated across the U.S. as California is home to the top companies

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,820
in the industry. Proposals to regulate AI nationally have made little progress in Washington.

18
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,800
The governor announced that he is working with leading AI researchers including

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,600
Fai Fai Lee, a Stanford University professor who has worked at Google and recently launched a startup

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,100
called World Labs to develop new legislation he is willing to support. Newsom signed other AI-related

21
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,000
bills into law this year. They include one requiring AI developers to label content created by their

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,400
technology and others regulating election-related deepfakes and giving performers more control over

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,620
digital replicas of themselves. The bill he vetoed, SB 1047, would have required developers of large AI

24
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,560
models to take, quote, reasonable care to ensure that their technology didn't pose, end quote,

25
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:24,820
unreasonable risk of causing or materially enabling a critical harm. It defined that harm as cyberattacks

26
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:30,440
that cause at least $500 million in damages or mass casualties. Developers also would have needed

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,500
to ensure their AI could be shut down by a human if it started behaving dangerously. The bill applied

28
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,160
to AI models that met a certain computing power threshold and cost at least $100 million to train,

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,780
the estimated cost of OpenAI's biggest model, GPT-4. Any company doing business in California,

30
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,600
regardless of where it is headquartered, was covered. Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,580
concerns about the bill, saying it imposed vague standards in the name of safety. Many smaller

32
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,420
companies joined them, arguing the bill would chill innovation by discouraging large developers from

33
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,180
making their models available to the public, fracturing a startup ecosystem that relies on such openness

34
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,000
to innovate. The bill would have prohibited developers from releasing large AI models, quote,

35
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,060
if there is an unreasonable risk that the technology will cause or materially enable a critical harm.

36
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,100
Tech companies said the language opened a legal minefield. Nobody knows what that means.

37
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,920
So you're basically leaving it to a court that's non-technical, said Martin Casado,

38
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,340
a partner overseeing AI investments at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, end quote.

39
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,040
One more real quick, though, it's not quite related. Governor Newsom also signed the California

40
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:44,020
Neuro Rights Act into law that treats neural data as personal sensitive information aiming to protect

41
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,260
brain data from misuse, quoting the Times.

42
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,920
On Saturday, Governor Gavin Newsom of California signed a new law that aims to protect people's

43
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,480
brain data from being potentially misused by neurotechnology companies. A growing number of

44
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,340
consumer technology products promise to help address cognitive issues, apps to meditate, to improve focus,

45
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,420
and to treat mental health conditions like depression. These products monitor and record brain data,

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,480
which encodes virtually everything that goes on in the mind, including thoughts, feelings,

47
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,180
and intentions. The new law, which passed both the California State Assembly and the Senate with no

48
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,160
voter opposition, amends the state's current personal privacy law known as the California Consumer

49
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,460
Privacy Act by including neural data under personal sensitive information. This includes data generated by a

50
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,760
user's brain activity and the meshwork of nerves that extends to the rest of the body, end quote.

51
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:45,360
Mark Gurman Newsletter Monday this weekend. Mark took a look at the fallout from the demo

52
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,360
of those meta Orion prototype smart glasses. Mark straight out came out and said, even though it was just a

53
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,820
demo, it made even him think that Apple's strategy with the Vision Pro might be a mistake. Quote,

54
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,760
Apple seems aware that it needs to rethink its approach to headsets, but there isn't consensus

55
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,140
on how to do that, I'm told. As of now, the company's Vision products group is evaluating a

56
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,000
few different options, including the status quo route. This would involve keeping the Vision Pro

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,380
more or less the same but focusing on a less expensive version. Apple could bring down the

58
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,580
costs with cheaper materials, lesser internal technologies, and lower quality displays. The company

59
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,800
would also follow up with a second-generation version of the original higher-end Vision Pro that has a

60
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,280
new chip and Apple intelligence. The smart display route. In this scenario, Apple would remove the

61
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,880
onboard computer and external battery from the Vision Pro and shift many of the internal functions

62
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,720
over to the iPhone. This would make the iPhone more valuable, reduce the weight and heat of the headset,

63
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,260
and more importantly, eliminate several hundred dollars worth of components to bring down the price.

64
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,660
Then there's the smart glasses route. This would mean developing a product that's closer to

65
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,260
Meta's hit collaboration with Ray-Ban, smart glasses without AR. Apple could use its expertise in chips

66
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,240
and audio, as well as its growing collection of AI tools to make a compelling device. This would

67
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,880
essentially be a Me Too product, but also something akin to an AirPods on steroids, and Apple fans would

68
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,420
probably eat it up. There's then the AI and AirPods route. Apple is working on a new version of the

69
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,540
AirPods Pro that uses external cameras and artificial intelligence to understand the outside world and

70
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,100
provide information to the user. This would essentially be the smart glasses path, but without actual glasses.

71
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:34,540
Finally, there's the holy grail route. The ultimate goal is standalone augmented reality spectacles that

72
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,920
come with high-performing lenses, a battery system, onboard computer, cameras, eye tracking, and other

73
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,580
components built in, all while still being the size and weight of normal glasses. This has long been

74
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,780
Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook's dream, but Apple previously paused development of such a product

75
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,860
because it was just too big a challenge. Apple could ultimately release some or all of these products,

76
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,420
but it's going to need to accelerate its work and fast. If not, Apple will risk losing out on a product

77
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,300
category that could transform the way people use technology."

78
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:14,220
Speaking of Apple, the journal says that Apple is no longer in talks to participate in OpenAI's

79
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,460
funding round that is expected to raise as much as $6.5 billion and close as soon as next week.

80
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,920
Not sure we can or need to make anything out of that particularly right now, but it seems like that

81
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,940
round is coming, which is making people take a hard look at where OpenAI is at the moment financially.

82
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,300
The New York Times has been working their sources and say OpenAI had $300 million in monthly revenue

83
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:47,900
in August, up 1,700% since early 2023. They had 350 million monthly active users in June and expect

84
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:54,500
around $3.7 billion in annual sales this year, but also, of course, $5 billion in losses.

85
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:01,360
Reuters worked their sources to report that OpenAI expects its revenue to grow to $11.6 billion next year.

86
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,460
ChatGPT has 10 million paying users and could bring in $2.7 billion in revenue this year,

87
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,500
up from $700 million in 2023. But again, the question really is, is that growth sustainable if the cost of

88
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,460
providing the product you provide is so expensive? So the journal took a look at the challenges OpenAI is facing

89
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,400
if it indeed becomes a for-profit company, which I guess it needs to do to address all that.

90
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,920
This includes the complexity of splitting assets with the non-profit arm, which, I hadn't thought of this,

91
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,500
might continue to exist. Quoting the journal.

92
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,960
The ChatGPT maker is in the midst of raising $6.5 billion from bankers including Microsoft and NVIDIA,

93
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,120
along with venture capital firms and a United Arab Emirates state-backed company.

94
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,780
An essential provision of talks is that OpenAI, currently governed by a charitable non-profit,

95
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,120
must within two years become a public benefit corporation. That means its mission is to earn

96
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,240
profit while creating social good. If it doesn't, investors could take back their money.

97
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,380
To get there, it will have to deal with regulatory requirements in at least two states,

98
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,700
determine how to award equity in the for-profit company,

99
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,880
and split assets with the non-profit entity, which will continue to exist.

100
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,780
This kind of transaction is incredibly complex and would involve a large number of legal and

101
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,660
regulatory hurdles that would need to be navigated, said Karen Blackenstone,

102
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,780
general counsel at the investment firm Hanger Management and an attorney specializing in

103
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,360
technology and tax-exempt organizations. OpenAI is a Delaware-based corporation and would need to

104
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,440
change its structure legally under that state's law. Given Delaware's business-friendly legal regime,

105
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,420
making that change would be the easiest part of the process, said Jill Horwitz, a law professor and

106
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:50,100
founding faculty director of the Lowell-Milken Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits at the

107
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,840
University of California, Los Angeles. The more complicated part is what would happen to OpenAI's

108
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,960
assets. When such a conversion takes place, it can't simply shift assets from a non-profit to a

109
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,520
for-profit. The non-profit is legally required to end up with assets, including any cash and securities,

110
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:12,040
at least as valuable as those it turns over, to the for-profit. In effect, OpenAI's operations would

111
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,160
likely be sold to the for-profit company or its investors with the charity retaining the proceeds.

112
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,480
Assets, quote, previously donated to the public benefit cannot be repurposed to private benefit

113
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,860
without compensating the public for the loss, said Alexander Reed, a partner at the law firm

114
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,840
Baker Hostetler. It couldn't be determined how much the remaining non-profit would receive in such a

115
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,680
transaction, given that OpenAI is expected to be valued at around $150 billion after the current

116
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,880
fundraising round. The amount could be immense. That determination is particularly complicated

117
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,800
because the non-profit might own some of OpenAI's patents on AI technology, which would need to be

118
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,200
valued in the conversion. Because most of OpenAI's operations are in California, that state's attorney

119
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,640
general would have jurisdiction to ensure its charitable assets were protected, according to legal experts.

120
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,660
OpenAI hasn't said what the continuing non-profit would do once a profit-seeking company takes over

121
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,260
all of its operations. The current non-profit has supported research on universal basic income

122
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,260
programs and made charitable grants focused on technology and social equality. According to its

123
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,200
website, it could continue to fund such work in the future, using its stake in the for-profit OpenAI

124
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,700
as a source of income. One important issue OpenAI will have to resolve in the conversion is what

125
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,780
rights the non-profit will have to AI technology that the new company develops, end quote.

126
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,580

139
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:53,540
I'm someone who's rounding my 40s and I'm getting the aches and pains that just won't go away all of a sudden.

140
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,500
Sometimes I just sleep wrong and something will hurt for weeks. So that's why I've been trying

141
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:05,320
Urolithin A. Urolithin A is a powerful postbiotic that is nearly impossible to get from your diet alone.

142
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,740
And MitoPure from Timeline is the first product to offer a precise dose of Urolithin A to upgrade your

143
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,580
mitochondrial function. Also increase cellular energy and improve muscle strength and endurance.

144
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,780
MitoPure is clinically shown to give our cellular energy generators new power by triggering the body's

145
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,960
natural process for removing and rebuilding damaged mitochondria called mitophagy. By taking two soft gels a day

146
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,060
for two months, you can see significant improvements in your cellular energy, your muscle strength, and your

endurance. After four months of taking MitoPure, you'll feel yourself getting stronger, recovering faster

153
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:09,180
If you've searched for some music videos from some high-profile artists recently,

154
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:16,100
you might have come away disappointed. Why? Well, quoting Variety, songs by Adele, Bob Dylan,

155
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:22,320
Green Day, REM, Burn a Boy, Rush, and many others are currently unplayable on YouTube in the U.S. due

156
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,740
to a legal dispute between the platform and the performing rights organization, CSAC. Attempts to

157
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,960
play many but not all songs by those artists on Saturday met with the following message.

158
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,500
This video contains content from CSAC. It is not available in your country. A similar dispute

159
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,080
between Universal Music Group and TikTok raged on for several months earlier this year before being

160
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,900
resolved. In a statement to Variety, a YouTube rep said, we have held good faith negotiations with

161
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,960
CSAC to renew our existing deal. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we were unable to reach an

162
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,880
equitable agreement before its expiration. We take copyright very seriously, and as a result,

163
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,300
content represented by CSAC is no longer available on YouTube in the U.S. We are in active conversations

164
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,680
with CSAC and are hoping to reach a new deal as soon as possible. Reps for CSAC did not immediately

165
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,260
respond to requests for comment. A source close to the situation tells Variety that the previous deal

166
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,940
actually does not expire until next week and suggests that YouTube's move is a negotiating tactic.

167
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:27,260
CSAC is far smaller than ASCAP and BMI, with approximately 30,000 members and 1.5 million

168
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:33,260
compositions, while ASCAP has nearly 800,000 members. But as the caliber of artists affected

169
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,380
by the block shows, it represents a comparatively large percentage of the marketplace."

170
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,780
End quote.

171
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,960
Finally today, I think we've spoken about this before, but maybe not.

172
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:55,140
Back in September of 2022, the X100 series of point-and-shoot digital cameras went viral on TikTok.

173
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,200
This has led to huge profits for Fujifilm. Imagine that. Huge profits in camera hardware that

174
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,360
isn't a smartphone, quoting Bloomberg.

175
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:11,760
In September 2022, the photographer and TikTok influencer Kylie Katich posted a video showing off

176
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,660
her Fujifilm X100V.

177
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,160
I just found a camera that will change your life, she told hundreds of thousands of followers at the

178
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,880
time as photos of her infant flashed by. With the warm yellowish glow, the images look like they

179
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,480
could have been pulled out of a photo album from a generation ago. The camera itself, with its jacket

180
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,800
pocket-sized aluminum body, had distinctly vintage features and came programmed with simulations that

181
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,260
mimic the look of photographic film without any editing. It looks like a film camera. It has settings

182
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,640
like a film camera, Katich said in the video, holding up the $1,400 point-and-shoot. It's digital.

183
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,960
Within a day, her post had racked up dozens of comments. Consider me influenced. I am deaf-getting.

184
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,280
One person replied, this is the coolest thing ever, said another.

185
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,880
The endorsement and others like it reverberated through TikTok's sub-communities.

186
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,520
Auto enthusiasts brought their X100Vs to sports car meetups. Musicians took theirs around the world to

187
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,460
document the touring lifestyle. Tech geeks, travel junkies, and fashion influencers all wanted an X100V,

188
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,340
and once they got one, they let their own followers know. The effect on the company's inventory,

189
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,240
already strained by a global chip shortage, was drastic. By November 2022, Fujifilm stopped accepting

190
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,220
online orders for the camera, citing its inability to keep up with demand. Buyers turned to resale

191
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,820
platforms such as eBay, where X100Vs were selling for twice their retail value. Two years later,

192
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,500
TikTok's obsession hasn't slowed, and the manufacturer is still reaping the benefits.

193
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,540
Fujifilm's photo imaging segment brought in $3.3 billion for the fiscal year that ended in March,

194
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,820
a 14.5% year-over-year increase, and was the company's most profitable division for the first

195
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,560
time since at least 2006, when Bloomberg started tracking earnings by segment. Those sales were

196
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,420
driven in part by the X100V's successor. Sporting an upgraded sensor and other new features,

197
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:06,840
the X100V1, or VI, sold out almost immediately upon its release in February. Both generations

198
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,860
remain unavailable on Fujifilm's website. The company is embracing the camera's coveted status,

199
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,960
and a May earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Tiechi Gotu said the X100Vi's inventory situation was

200
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,660
normal and compared the product's resale value to that of a prestigious competitor. Leica, a well-known

201
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,020
German manufacturer, still maintains a very high value for both their old cameras and the cameras

202
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,140
they sell now, and this is our goal, Gotu said in the call. Fujifilm, which declined requests for

203
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,420
interviews, said in a statement that it's accelerating production to meet demand. Our goal is that every

204
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,380
customer who ordered an X100Vi gets it, the company said, end quote.

205
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:54,100
Nothing for you today. Talk to you tomorrow.
